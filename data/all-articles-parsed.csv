Australia kills off carbon tax,Lenore Taylor,https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2014/jul/17/australia-kills-off-carbon-tax,Wed 16 Jul 2014 21.51 EDT,"Australia’s carbon price has been repealed, leaving the nation with no legislated policy to achieve even the minimum 5% greenhouse emissions reduction target it has inscribed in international agreements.

After eight years of bitter political debate, during which climate policy dominated three election campaigns and contributed to the demise of two prime ministers, after last week’s Senate drama in which the repeal was again defeated and this week’s lengthy last gasp debate, the Senate has now finally voted to make good Tony Abbott’s “pledge in blood” to “axe the tax”.

The government was backed by seven of the new crossbench senators, including the three Palmer United party senators, Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm, Family First senator Bob Day, Motoring Enthusiast senator Ricky Muir, DLP senator John Madigan. Independent senator Nick Xenophon was unwell.

Only the Australian Labor party and the Greens voted against repealing the carbon pricing scheme they introduced, which came into effect two years ago.

Leader of the government in the Senate and former climate change minister Penny Wong said repealing the bills meant “this nation will have walked away from a credible and efficient response to climate change”.

Wong said the prime minister Tony Abbott had “staked his political career … on fearmongering and scaremongering and that is what this debate has been about for years”.

“I think future generations will look back on these bills and they will be appalled … at the short-sighted, opportunistic selfish politics of those opposite and Mr Abbott will go down as one of the most short-sighted, selfish and small people ever to occupy the office of prime minister.”

Government backbencher Ian Macdonald accused opposition parties of being hypocrites for refusing to accept the will of the voters and said that while he had “an open mind”, he would like to point out that Brisbane had recently had its coldest day in 113 years.

Greens leader Christine Milne said it was “a vote for failure” amid interjections from government backbenchers that she should “get over it” because the parliament was “respecting the will of the Australian people.”

How the Senate voted

The bills passed 39:32. There was none of the jubilation that accompanied their passage in the lower house, but the leader of the government in the Senate, Eric Abetz, shook hands with backbench senator Cory Bernardi, who led the revolt against Malcolm Turnbull when, as leader of the opposition, he backed Labor’s carbon pricing scheme.

The tax was $25.40 a tonne and was scheduled to move to the floating and lower international price in 12 months.

The repeal will cost the budget around $7bn over the next four years as around 350 businesses, mainly electricity generators and big manufacturers, no longer have to pay the tax.

The government argues the carbon pricing scheme has been ineffective, but national emissions have actually fallen by 0.8% in the first calendar year of its operation, the largest fall in 24 years of records. Since the tax began, emissions from the east coast electricity market have fallen 11%, but emissions from other sources – especially coal and gas mining have increased.

The government also says households will be better off by an average $550 – the amount treasury estimated prices would rise when the tax was introduced – but supermarkets and airlines are now saying consumers should not expect price reductions.

The Australian Competition and Consumer Commission’s special powers are to monitor and enforce only electricity and gas price reductions. Electricity bills will rise, but by an estimated 9% less than they otherwise would. Gas bills will rise by an estimated 7% less than they would have with the tax still in place.

The Abbott government says it will now achieve the target of a 5% reduction in Australian emissions compared with 2000 levels by 2020 with its Direct Action policy, which will offer $2.5bn in competitive grants over the next four years to companies and organisations voluntarily reducing emissions. The budget actually allocated only $1.14bn over the four-year forward estimates for the scheme. The government said this is because they will pay on delivery of the abatement. The policy is voluntary and puts no overall cap on emissions.

The government itself has not modelled Direct Action (Abbott said he would prefer to “have a crack”), but two other modelling exercises found even the 5% cut would cost far more than $2.5bn, and the independent climate change authority – which the government is seeking to abolish – has said Australia’s “fair share” of international emissions reductions has now increased to between 15% and 19% by 2020.

The government says it is sure Direct Action will meet the 5% target, but Abbott has said he will not allocate any more money even if it does not, and has not said how he would make deeper reductions in Australia’s emissions which are likely to be required after the United Nations meeting to try to forge a new post-2020 climate agreement in Paris next year.

Malcolm Turnbull warned of the long-term costs of the policy in a speech to parliament after he was deposed as leader because of his support for an emissions trading scheme, when he said Direct Action style schemes were “a recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale”.

The carbon price repeal bills were voted down in the Senate last week after a last-minute change to a Palmer United party amendment was ruled to be unconstitutional by the clerk of the Senate. The government had been prepared to accept the amendment but then changed it again over the weekend after business groups raised major concerns.

Business groups welcomed the repeal as a “first step” towards achieving an effective emissions reduction policy.

The Business Council of Australia, the Minerals Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group called on the government to “develop and implement a cost-effective emissions reduction fund” as “part of a toolkit of measures to reduce emissions”.

But the Climate Institute thinktank said that “by repealing laws that price and limit carbon pollution, Australia today became the world’s first country to dismantle a functioning and effective carbon market, taking a monumentally reckless backward leap even as other major countries are stepping up climate action”.

And the Australian Conservation Foundation said: “This backwards step makes Australia an international embarrassment.”

Describing it as a “tragic day”, Greens leader senator Christine Milne said after the vote that “the big polluters should pay for the destruction they are causing to the planet”. She accused the Coalition of “wanting to cost-shift the burden of climate change onto the community and away from the people who are causing it”.

Both Labor and the Greens say they remain committed to carbon pricing as the best way to reduce emissions.

Speaking after the vote, agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce said the tax had imposed high costs on families, and questioned whether it was needed, saying “look at the weather today, look at the way you are dressed, no one thinks it is too hot”.

“I believe there is climate change happening, I just don’t believe we are going to change it with a broad-based consumption tax.”

“I am glad the carbon tax has been axed … we have Direct Action and there are programs that hopefully can assist … but the idea that somehow we inflict on every household the fact that we would attack their power prices to the Australian taxation offices. They took it to the Australian people and the Australian people rejected it,” Joyce said.",australia-carbon-tax,guardian.txt

* per tonne of emitted CO₂

A carbon pricing scheme in Australia was introduced by the Gillard Labor minority government in 2011 as the Clean Energy Act 2011 which came into effect on 1 July 2012. Emissions from companies subject to the scheme dropped 7 % upon its introduction \[2]. As a result of being in place for such a short time, and because the then Opposition leader Tony Abbott indicated he intended to repeal “the carbon tax”, regulated organizations responded rather weakly, with very few investments in emissions reductions being made \[3]. The scheme was repealed on 17 July 2014, backdated to 1 July 2014. In its place the Abbott government set up the Emission Reduction Fund in December 2014. Emissions thereafter resumed their growth evident before the tax \[4].

The carbon price was part of a broad energy reform package called the Clean Energy Futures Plan, which aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Australia by 5 % below 2000 levels by 2020 and 80 % below 2000 levels by 2050. Although Australia does not levy a direct carbon price \[5], the plan set out to achieve these targets by encouraging Australia’s largest emitters to increase energy efficiency and invest in sustainable energy. The scheme was administered by the Clean Energy Regulator. Compensation to industry and households was funded by the revenue derived from the charge. The scheme required entities which emit over 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gases per year, and which were not in the transport or agriculture sectors, to obtain emissions permits, called carbon units. Carbon units were either purchased from the government or issued free as part of industry assistance measures. As part of the scheme, personal income tax was reduced for those earning less than A\$80,000 per year and the tax-free threshold was increased from A\$6,000 to A\$18,200 \[6]. Initially the price of a permit for one tonne of carbon was fixed at A\$23 for the 2012–13 financial year, with unlimited permits being available from the government. The fixed price rose to A\$24.15 for 2013–14.

The government had announced that the scheme was part of a transition to an emissions trading scheme in 2014–15, where the available permits will be limited in line with a pollution cap. The scheme primarily applied to electricity generators and industrial sectors. It did not apply to road transport and agriculture. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency stated that in June 2013 only 260 entities were subject to the scheme \[7], of which approximately 185 were liable to pay for carbon units. Domestic aviation did not face the carbon price scheme, but was subject to an additional fuel excise levy of approximately 6 cents per liter.

In February 2012, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that Clean Energy Future carbon price scheme had not deterred new investment in the coal industry, as spending on exploration had increased by 62 % in 2010–2011, more than any other mineral commodity. The government agency Geoscience Australia reported that investment in coal prospecting reached \$520 million in 2010–2011 \[8]. Falls in carbon emissions were observed following implementation of this policy \[9]. It was noted that emissions from sectors subject to the pricing mechanism were 1.0 % lower \[10] and nine months after the introduction of the pricing scheme, Australia’s carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation had fallen to a 10-year low, with coal generation down 11 % from 2008 to 2009 \[11]. However, attribution of these trends to carbon pricing have been disputed, with Frontier Economics claiming trends are largely explained by factors unrelated to the carbon tax \[12]\[13]. Electricity demand had been falling and in 2012 was at the lowest level seen since 2006 in the National Electricity Market \[14].

## History

Economy-wide pricing of carbon is the centre piece of any policy designed to reduce emissions at the lowest possible costs.
— Ross Garnaut \[15]

In 2003, the Howard Government was close to creating an emissions trading scheme, but business lobbying caused the government to stop considering it in September of that year \[16]. In October 2006 the Stern Review on the effect of climate change on the world’s economy was released for the British government. This report recommended a range of measures including ecotaxes to address the market failure represented by climate change with the least amount of economic and social disruption. In response to this report and subsequent pressure from the Kim Beazley led Labor opposition, in December 2006 the Howard government established the Prime Ministerial Task Group on Emissions Trading, chaired by Peter Shergold, to advise on the implementation of an emissions trading scheme (ETS) in Australia \[17]\[18]. In opposition, Kevin Rudd called for a cut to greenhouse gas emissions by 60 % before 2050 \[19]. Both the incumbent Howard government and the Rudd Labor opposition promised to implement an emissions trading scheme (ETS) before the 2007 federal election. Following the release of the final Shergold report, the Howard government committed to introduce an ETS in June 2007 \[20]\[21].

Going into the 2007 federal election, the Labor opposition party presented itself as a “pro-climate” alternative to the Government, with Kevin Rudd, who had by then deposed Beazley as leader, famously describing climate change as “the great moral challenge of our generation”. Labor differentiated itself from the government by promising an ETS with an earlier start date of 2010 rather than the 2012 timeframe advocated by Howard. It also promised ratification of the Kyoto Protocol, investment in clean coal and renewable energy, and slightly more aggressive targets for renewable energy \[17].

Labor won the election on 24 November 2007, and on 3 December 2007 the Rudd government signed the ratification of the Kyoto Protocol at the 2007 United Nations Climate Change Conference. By ratifying the Kyoto Protocol, Australia committed to keeping emissions to no more than 108 % of its 1990 emissions level by 2012. Australia’s ratification came into effect on 11 March 2008 \[22].

The Rudd government began negotiating the passage of an ETS through the Parliament. The Opposition led by Brendan Nelson called for the vote on the government’s ETS be delayed until after the United Nations climate change summit in Copenhagen in December 2009. Prime Minister Rudd said in response that it would be “an act of absolute political cowardice, an absolute failure of leadership not to act on climate change until other nations had done so” and the government pursued the early introduction of the Scheme \[23].

On 16 July 2008, the Rudd government released a green paper for its Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme (CPRS) (also known as Australia’s ETS), outlining the intended design of the scheme. The CPRS was criticised by those who were both for and against action to mitigate climate change. Environmental lobby groups protested that the emissions reductions targets were too low, and that the level of assistance to polluters was too high. Industry and business lobby groups however argued for more permits and assistance to offset the economic impacts of the scheme on many enterprises, particularly during the 2008 financial crisis \[17]. Malcolm Turnbull became the new Liberal Opposition Leader on 18 September 2008. On 30 September 2008, the Garnaut Climate Change Review, commissioned in April 2007 by Rudd when he was leader of the Opposition, released its final report. Garnaut recommended a price between \$20 and \$30 per tonne of carbon dioxide (CO₂) equivalent with a rise of 4 % each year \[15]. A more detailed white paper on the CPRS was released on 15 December 2008 \[24].

Unable to secure the support of the crossbench for their preferred model, the government entered negotiations with Turnbull, and in the lead up to the Copenhagen Conference, presented an amended CPRS scheme, with the support of Turnbull. The Turnbull-led Opposition supported the CPRS scheme in principle, although at times over 2009 they indicated disagreement with various details including the timing of implementation of the scheme, timing of the vote on the relevant legislation and on the level of assistance to be provided to polluting industries. The Opposition was able to negotiate greater compensation for polluters affected by the scheme in November 2009 \[17]\[25].

Shortly before the Senate was due to vote on the carbon bills, on 1 December 2009 Tony Abbott replaced Turnbull as leader of the Liberal Party \[26]. Abbott immediately called a secret ballot on support for the ETS among coalition MPs, which was overwhelmingly rejected \[27]. The Coalition then withdrew their support for the carbon pricing policy and joined the Greens and Independents in voting against the relevant legislation in the Parliament of Australia on 2 December 2009 \[28]. As the Rudd government required the support of either the Coalition or the Greens to secure passage of the bill, it was defeated in the Senate. Abbott described Labor’s ETS plan as a ‘Great big tax on everything’.

Abbott announced a new Coalition policy on carbon emission reduction in February 2010, which committed the Coalition to a 5 % reduction in emissions by 2020. Abbott proposed the creation of an ‘emissions reduction fund’ to provide ‘direct’ incentives to industry and farmers to reduce carbon emissions \[29]. In April 2010, Rudd deferred attempts to advance the scheme to at least 2013 \[30], opting not to present the legislation to the Senate a second time, creating a trigger for a double dissolution election. In June 2010, Julia Gillard replaced Rudd as leader of the Labor Party and became prime minister. Factional leader and key Gillard supporter Bill Shorten said that the sudden announcement of change of policy on the ETS was a factor that had contributed to a collapse in support for Rudd’s leadership \[31].

Shortly afterwards Gillard called a federal election for 21 August 2010. During the election campaign Gillard stated that she supported a price on carbon emissions and that she would prosecute the case for action for as long as she needed to win community support \[32]. However, she also indicated that she would not introduce carbon pricing until there was a sufficient consensus on the issue \[33], that any carbon price legislated would not come into effect until after the 2013 election \[34], and she specifically ruled out the introduction of a “carbon tax” \[32].

The result of the election left Australia with its first hung parliament in 70 years. To form a majority in the House of Representatives both of the major parties needed to acquire the support of cross-benchers, including the Greens. After two weeks of negotiations Gillard had enough support to gain a majority including the support of the Greens and their single MP in the House, Adam Bandt. Gillard, therefore, remained prime minister and Abbott remained in Opposition. One of the conditions for Greens support was that the formation of a cross-party parliamentary committee to determine policy on climate change. Gillard honoured that agreement and on 27 September 2010 the Multi-Party Climate Change Committee (MPCCC) was formed, its terms of reference including that it was to report to Cabinet on ways to introduce a carbon price \[35]\[36]. The MPCCC agreed on the introduction of a fixed carbon price commencing 1 July 2012, transitioning to a flexible-price cap-and-trade ETS on 1 July 2015 \[37]. Initially the price of permits is fixed and the quantity unlimited i.e. there is no cap; the scheme thus functions similarly, and is popularly referred to as a tax.

In February 2011, the government proposed the Clean Energy Bill \[38], which the opposition claimed to be a broken election promise \[39]. The Liberal Party vowed to overturn the bill if it was elected \[40].

The Gillard government had asked the Productivity Commission to report on the steps taken by eight major economies to address climate change. In June 2011, the report found that more than 1,000 climate policies were already enacted across the globe \[41]\[42]. It also supported a market-based carbon price as being the most cost-effective way to reduce emissions \[42]. The report’s findings were one of the major reasons that support for the carbon tax was provided by independent Tony Windsor \[42]. Windsor made it clear that he would not support the clean energy legislation if it included a carbon tax on transport fuels \[43]. He did not want to penalise people who lived in rural areas, where there was no public transport as an alternative to private vehicles.

The Clean Energy Plan was released on 10 July 2011 \[28]. The Clean Energy Bill 2011 passed the Australian House of Representatives in October 2011 and the Australian Senate in November 2011 and was thus brought into law \[44]\[45].

On 1 July 2012 the Australian Federal government introduced a carbon price scheme. To offset the impact of the tax on some sectors of society, the government reduced income tax (by increasing the tax-free threshold) and increased pensions and welfare payments slightly to cover expected price increases, as well as introducing compensation for some affected industries. On 17 July 2014, a report by the Australian National University estimated that the Australian scheme had cut carbon emissions by as much as 17 million tonnes, the biggest annual reduction in greenhouse gas emissions in 24 years of records in 2013 as the carbon tax helped drive a large drop in pollution from the electricity sector \[46].

On 17 July 2014, the Abbott government passed repeal legislation through the Senate to abolish the carbon pricing scheme \[47]. In its place the government set up the Emission Reduction Fund \[48], paid by taxpayers from consolidated revenue, which according to RepuTex, a markets consultancy, estimated the government’s main climate policy may only meet a third of the emissions reduction challenge if Australia is to cut by 5 % of 2000 levels by 2020 \[49].

## Scope and covered emissions

The carbon price came into effect on 1 July 2012 and applied to direct emissions from a facility (scope-1 emissions), but not to indirect emissions (scope-2 emissions). The scheme only applied to facilities which emit more than 25,000 tonnes CO₂-e per year, and did not apply to agriculture or to transport fuels. The carbon price was set at AUD \$23 per tonne of emitted CO₂-e on selected fossil fuels consumed by major industrial emitters and government bodies such as councils.

Agricultural emissions were exempt due to difficulty in tracking emissions and the related complexity of administering such a scheme \[50]. Households and business use of light vehicles did not incur a carbon price. However, changes to the fuel tax regime were proposed to effectively impose a carbon tax on business liquid and gaseous fuel emissions. There were plans for heavy on-road vehicles to pay from 1 July 2014 \[51].

In effect, the scope of the scheme meant that only a small number of large electricity generators and larger industrial plants were subject to the carbon price scheme. The tax was payable by surrendering carbon units, which had been either purchased (at \$20 per tonne in 2012–13) or acquired free under an industry assistance program. The pricing mechanism was expected to cover 60 % of Australia’s carbon emissions \[1]. 75 % of each company’s annual obligation were to be paid by 15 June each year with the remaining 25 % by the following 1 February.

A list of companies which had paid the carbon tax, and the amount which each had paid, was published by the Clean Energy Regulator (CER) \[52]\[53]. This was called the Liable Entities Public Information Database or LEPID. The LEPID for 2012–13 was updated on 12 July 2013 and the companies which were the fifteen largest payers of carbon tax in 2012–13 are shown in the summary below (related companies are grouped together where identifiable).

## Industry assistance programs

The Government ran several major ‘Industry Assistance’ programs to reduce the impact of carbon tax for the 185 affected companies. These have the effect of significantly reducing the actual carbon tax raised.

### Jobs and Competitiveness Program

The ‘Jobs and Competitiveness Program’ was for the non-electricity sector and was targeted at the ‘emissions-intensive trade-exposed’ activities – that is, companies which emitted a lot of CO₂ and were exposed to imports or who trade internationally. There was a list of 48 trade-exposed activities, including business such as steel making, alumina refining, cement making and similar activities.

Depending on whether a company was ‘highly’ or ‘moderately’ emissions intensive, it received 94.5 % or 66 % of ‘average industry carbon costs’ supplied as free carbon units.

Overall in 2012–13 under the ‘Jobs and Competitiveness Program’, there were 104 million free carbon units issued to 123 applicants, valued at approximately \$2.4 billion. The fifteen largest recipients of free carbon units in 2012–13, with related companies grouped together where identifiable, were:

### Coal Fired Generation Assistance

Under the ‘Coal Fired Generation Assistance’ for coal-based electricity generating companies the Government gave out 42 million of free carbon units each year, valued at almost \$5 billion. These were only issued to the generators with the highest amount of CO₂ emission intensity, above 1.0 tonne of CO₂ per MWh of energy. These were primarily the brown coal-fired generators in Victoria’s Latrobe Valley.

The free units were shared according to their size and the amount of CO₂ produced compared to a more efficient black coal-fired power station. The list of companies which received the free units was published by the Clean Energy Regulator \[55]. Nine power stations qualified – the big four brown coal plants in Victoria, and five other much smaller plants. The four big brown coal plants in Victoria received the majority share of free carbon units, around 37 million of the 42 million free carbon units in September each year.

With an average emissions intensity of 1.3, that effectively meant there was no carbon tax on the first 20 TWh (or approximately 50 %) they collectively produced each year.

### Steel Transformation Plan package

The Steel Transformation Plan was a A\$500 million package for Australia’s two steelmakers. In 2012, payments of A\$160 million were made, A\$200 M to BlueScope and A\$70 M to OneSteel.

## Effect of the carbon price

### Reduction in emissions of greenhouse gases

Because the Australian carbon tax did not apply to all fossil fuels usage, it only had an effect on some of the emitters of greenhouse gases. Among those emitters to which it applied, emissions were significantly lower after introduction of the tax. According to the Investor Group on Climate Change, emissions from companies subject to the tax went down 7 % with the introduction of the tax, and the tax was “the major contributor” to this reduction \[2].

### Continuing growth in greenhouse emissions

Australia’s total greenhouse gas emissions increased by 0.3 % in the first six months of the Carbon Tax to December 2012 to 276.5 Mt CO₂ equiv \[56], while Australia’s gross domestic product grew at a rate of 2.5 % per year.

Greenhouse emissions from stationary energy (excluding electricity) and transport grew by 4 % in the first six months of the carbon tax to December 2012.

However, there is a five-year trend for emissions from the electricity generation sector in Australia to decline. Electricity emissions peaked at 38 % of the national total in September quarter 2008, coinciding with the start of the 2008 financial crisis. In December 2012, electricity emissions were just 33 % of national emissions. The decline is due partly to an almost 6 % reduction in electricity demand in the National Electricity market since 2008. This fall in electricity demand followed:
· Retail electricity prices rising by approximately 80 % over the past five years;
· Reduced economic activity and closure of the Kurri Kurri aluminium smelter in mid-2012; and
· A burst in residential solar PV generation following generous State Government incentives, now all curtailed.

Other factors contributing to the five-year fall in greenhouse emissions from the electricity sector are:
· An increase in wind generation supported by the Renewable Energy Target subsidies; and
· Fuel switching from coal to gas.

The Australian Government said in July 2013 that the carbon tax was a factor in reducing the emissions intensity in the National Electricity Market from 0.92 t of CO₂ per MWh to 0.87 in the 11 months following its introduction \[57].

Since the carbon tax was introduced, wholesale electricity prices in the National Electricity market increased significantly. The Energy Users Association of Australia in its June 2013 paper said that electricity generators have been able to pass through more than 100 % of the cost of the carbon tax. “If the outcomes observed in the spot market persist then it can be unequivocally concluded that both fossil fuel generators and renewable generators will have gained as a result of emission pricing, at users’ expense. Surely this is not what was intended.” \[58]

### Alternative explanations of emissions reductions

Frontier Economics said the reduction in emissions from the electricity sector in the first year of the carbon tax was ‘largely explained by factors unrelated to the carbon tax’. \[12]\[13]

The Energy Users Association of Australia (EUAA) said in June 2013 “we suggest that it cannot be said that pricing emissions has reduced emissions in stationary energy to any meaningful extent” \[58]

### Significant announcements which have, or may have, relevance to the carbon tax

AGL – In relation to its purchase of the Loy Yang brown coal fired power station in 2012, one of the single largest emitters of CO₂ in Australia states “On the supply side of the business, the most significant strategic development was the decision to buy the Loy Yang A power station. … The Board also recognised that coal fired generation would be required for decades to come if the demand from Australian households and businesses for electricity was to continue to be satisfied” \[59]

Adelaide Brighton (Australia’s second largest cement producer) – “AdelaideBrighton expects it will significantly mitigate the impact of the carbon tax over the next five years by:
· Enhancing its import flexibility;

· Increasing the use of alternative fuels and cementitious substitutes” \[60]

### Investments as a result of carbon tax

David Kassulke, the manager of AJ Bush & Sons, expressed grave concerns over the carbon tax during the lead up to its implementation. However, he later stated the carbon tax has had a positive impact on the business. The company expects to cut carbon emissions from 85,000 to 30,000 tonnes per year with the construction of a new biogas plant in 2013.

“The end result of the introduction of the new biogas technology will not only be a saving of millions of dollars in energy and carbon costs, but also an opportunity for the company to be positioned at the cutting edge of renewable energy technology in the rendering industry, Mr Kassulke said.” “It means companies are now looking at ways to use less energy which equates to less cost and a subsequent reduction in the tax that is being levied.” “That has been the intention of the tax and clearly from that perspective it is working and working well”. \[62]

## Political and industry response

The introduction of a carbon price in Australia was controversial. The day before the 2010 federal election, Prime Minister, Julia Gillard sent out a message regarding carbon pricing, stating “I don’t rule out the possibility of legislating a Carbon Pollution Reduction Scheme, a market-based mechanism.” However the article also articulated her position on that term of government. “While any carbon price would not be triggered until after the 2013 election… She would legislate the carbon price next term if sufficient consensus existed”, \[63] and the federal opposition accused the government of breaking an election promise to not introduce a carbon tax \[64]. Julia Gillard responded to these accusations by saying that circumstances changed following the 2010 election \[65]\[66]. Then opposition leader Tony Abbott criticised the carbon pricing policy on economic grounds referring to it as “toxic” and likening it to an octopus embracing the whole of the economy \[67]. He pledged to repeal the tax after the 18 clean energy bills passed through the House of Representatives and stated that the next election would be a referendum on the “carbon tax” \[68]\[69].

The opposition (and since the 2013 election the Abbott government) proposed an alternative “direct-action” carbon emissions reduction scheme. Modelling produced by the Department of the Treasury indicated that this scheme would cost twice as much as the Clean Energy Futures Plan \[70]. Abbott was unable to find an Australian economist who supported his policy, although he did cite international economists who are supportive \[71]. Tony Abbott’s “Direct Action Plan” has been criticised because there is no disincentive to continue polluting at the same rate, meaning that emissions will increase rather than decrease by 2020. In addition, “under Direct Action it is the public, not polluters who pay.” \[72]

The Australian Renewable Energy Agency (ARENA) was established as part of the Clean Energy Fund, and commenced operations on 1 July 2012. It consolidated existing renewable energy technology innovation programs. It had funds to provide financial assistance to research, develop, demonstrate, deploy and commercialise renewable energy in Australia and related technologies \[73]. The government-established but independent Clean Energy Finance Corporation (CEFC) commenced investment operations from 1 July 2013, with a focus on investments in renewable energy, low-emissions and energy efficiency technology and the manufacturing companies that produce materials used in such technologies \[74].

The majority of big emitters in Australia supported a price on carbon as at July 2012 \[75]. However business groups and some big emitters, especially in the mining sector, were opposed to the pricing scheme \[76].

Research by Preston Teeter and Jorgen Sandberg at the University of Queensland revealed that liable organisations responded with very few investments in emissions reduction activities, largely due to the great deal of policy uncertainty surrounding the scheme \[3].

## Effects and impacts

Further information: Mitigation of global warming in Australia

The carbon pricing scheme was intended to improve energy efficiency, convert electricity generation from coal to alternatives and shift economic activity towards a low carbon economy \[83]. Its impact on business was forecast to be 0.1 – 0.2 % lower than the business as usual scenario \[84]. The scheme aimed to prevent 160 million tonnes of carbon dioxide from entering the atmosphere by 2020 \[85], as well as generating \$24 billion over three years \[86].

In May 2012, the Australian Competition & Consumer Commission (ACCC) reported it was investigating about 100 cases where customers had possibly been misled into paying excessive price rises falsely claimed to be as a result of the carbon tax \[87]. By the middle of June, the commission was investigating about 200 cases \[88]. The consumer watchdog also set up a phone hotline and online form for complaints regarding excess pricing claimed to be due to the carbon tax. The ACCC had forecast that home construction costs would be at the lower end of the 0.7 % to 1.8 % range predicted by building companies \[89]. The Housing Industry Association estimated an average new house would experience a price increase of between 0.8 % and 1.7 % due to the carbon price \[90]. Housing construction was expected to be significantly impacted by the carbon tax because new homes require cement, bricks, aluminium, and glass, which are all typically energy-intensive materials \[91]. A forecast by the Centre for International Economics predicted the housing construction industry could decline by 12.6 % as a result of the carbon price \[91].

The coal industry was expected to be impacted due to the emissions produced as coal is mined, however a similar expense is not expected to be incurred by Australia’s coal exporting competitors \[83]. The Institute of Public Affairs claimed that the Australian coal industry would lose jobs to overseas competitors and mines will be closed \[92]. Despite the announcement of the scheme, spending on mineral exploration in the March quarter was the highest ever at \$1.086 billion \[93]. The impact on the LNG industry in Australia was expected to be minor to moderate \[94]. No major projects were expected to be cancelled as a result of the introduction of the carbon pricing scheme. Dairy farmers will be impacted because of higher power costs for milk processing \[95].

Household bills were expected to rise by an average of around \$5 per week \[96]. Energy retailer Synergy said the carbon price would result in a 7.1 % rise to power bills \[97].

## Compensation

Because carbon pricing would indirectly flow through to consumers, the Australian government implemented household assistance measures.

The measures included changes to income tax: the tax-free threshold increased from A\$6,000 to A\$18,200 on 1 July 2012, and was scheduled to rise to A\$19,400 from 1 July 2015 \[98]. The changes meant those earning less than A\$20,000 received a tax cut with those earning up to A\$5,000 receiving the greatest tax reduction \[99]\[100]. The changes were described as the biggest overhaul of taxation since the Goods and Services Tax was introduced in 2000 \[99].

Other steps included direct payments into bank accounts beginning in May 2012 \[101]. The payments, called the Clean Energy Advance, were targeted at low- and middle-income households \[102].

Some industries received direct compensation. As part of the Energy Security Fund, A\$1 billion was promised to highly emissions-intensive coal-fired generators \[103]. Most of that funding was intended for coal-fired power generators in Victoria \[104]. Research by the Grattan Institute suggested that no black coal mining or liquefied natural gas projects would be scrapped as a result of carbon pricing, regardless of industry compensation; it further claimed that, if coupled with compensation, the carbon pricing regime would in fact leave the steel industry better off \[105].

Under the Carbon Farming Initiative, farmers and graziers would have been able to plant trees to earn carbon credits, which could have been on-sold to companies liable to pay a carbon price \[106]. The Clean Technology Investment Program was touted as helping the manufacturing sector to support investments in “energy-efficient capital equipment and low emission technologies, processes and products” \[107]. Companies in the food sector would also have been able to apply for grants to improve their energy efficiency \[108].

## Emissions reduction

Six months after the introduction of carbon pricing the Department of Climate Change and Renewable Energy reported a 9 % decrease in emissions from electricity generators \[109].

Nine months after the introduction of the pricing scheme, Australia’s emissions of carbon dioxide due to electricity generation fell to a 10-year low, with coal generation down 6 % from 2008 to 2009 \[11].

## Repeal

Heading into the 2013 Australian federal election, the Liberal Party platform included the removal of the ‘Carbon Tax’, claiming that the election was in effect a referendum on carbon pricing in Australia. The incoming Liberal government placed removing the carbon pricing scheme at the head of its legislative program.

The carbon tax repeal legislation received Royal Assent on 17 July 2014 and the bills which were part of the package became law, with effect from 1 July 2014 \[110].

Australia is repealing its controversial carbon tax,Brad Plumer,https://www.vox.com/2014/7/17/5912143/australia-repeals-carbon-tax-global-warming,"Jul 17, 2014, 9:10 AM PDT","The carbon-tax experiment in Australia is now over.

Economists tend to prefer carbon pricing for tackling global warming

On Wednesday, the Australian Senate voted 39-32 to repeal the nation’s controversial tax on greenhouse-gas emissions. The tax, first passed in 2011, had charged people roughly $23 for every ton of carbon-dioxide they emitted from oil, coal, or gas.

The repeal is a big blow for climate policy. Economists have long argued that carbon pricing is one of the most effective ways to tackle global warming. The premise is simple: People should pay for the damage they cause by emitting carbon. And making fossil fuels more expensive will spur companies to seek out cleaner alternatives.

But the major weakness of a price on carbon has always been politics. So many daily activities depend on fossil fuels — from driving to home heating to industry — and the pinch from any tax is likely to be more noticeable than, say, that from more complex regulations. And that set up a major battle in Australia, which has one of the highest emissions per person rates in the world.

How Australia’s carbon tax worked — and why it fell.",australia-carbon-tax,vox.txt
Australia's key climate policy faces an uncertain future,Tom Lowrey,https://www.abc.net.au/news/2025-03-03/safeguard-mechanism-climate-policy-uncertain/104996022,Sun 2 Mar 2025,"Some business and climate groups have voiced their support for keeping one of the federal government's key climate policies in place, with the Coalition yet to commit to its future.

The safeguard mechanism was introduced under the Turnbull government nearly a decade ago, but was significantly strengthened under the Albanese government.

It caps the emissions of the country's heaviest-emitting companies and projects, and successively lowers that limit by roughly 5 per cent each year.

To stick to their caps, companies have to either lower their emissions or buy 'carbon credits'.

It's a key plank of the government's efforts to reach a 43 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030, and net zero by 2050.

The Coalition opposed the changes at the time and has kept up its criticism, but is yet to spell out whether it plans any changes to the scheme should it win government.

In a speech earlier this year, Peter Dutton compared it to the unpopular 'carbon pollution reduction scheme' introduced under the Gillard government — better known as the carbon tax.

""We've seen the safeguard mechanism turned into a new carbon tax — one [that is] three times higher than that implemented by Julia Gillard,"" he said.

At the time the safeguard mechanism changes were made, they were largely backed by business and industry groups who sought certainty for climate policies affecting their sectors.

Many of those groups argue that while there is room to adjust the scheme, it needs to stay.

Certainty critical

Industry groups rarely clamour for more government regulation, but climate policy was at one point something of an exception.

Groups like the Business Council of Australia complained of ""a decade of ad hoc and unstable energy and climate policy"" that had left the country on the ""back foot"" in achieving climate targets.

Others that did push back did so reasonably gently — the Minerals Council of Australia warned the country needed to 'thread the needle' and push down emissions, without pushing projects out of business.

Now that the policy is in place, some are arguing it is worth keeping.

Andrew McKellar from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says policy stability is critical for business.

Andrew McKellar has urged stability with the safeguard mechanism after years of tumult on climate policy. (ABC News: Matt Roberts)

He argues it should stay, but also warns against any plans to strengthen it further.

""From a business point of view, we have been supportive of the safeguard mechanism. It provides a level of structure and certainty,"" he said.

""We would caution against any move to lower thresholds or expand its perimeter.

""Having the safeguard mechanism in place is an important support to provide certainty for business, and moving the economy in the right direction towards the longer term goal of net zero by 2050.""

Energy Producers Australia represents much of Australia's gas industry, including major companies covered by the safeguard mechanism like Woodside, Origin and Shell.

Chief executive Samantha McCulloch isn't calling for the policy to be dumped, but does want to see flexibility — like avoiding overly onerous emissions caps, and the purchase of overseas-based carbon credits.

""The safeguard mechanism must be fit-for-purpose and balance emissions reductions with the need for energy affordability and reliability across the economy,"" she said.

""The safeguard mechanism needs to ensure that new and existing gas projects are not subject to excessive, unrealistic reduction targets, well beyond what has been achieved elsewhere, and that Australian LNG remains competitive in international markets.

""The safeguard mechanism should also allow access to robust and verified emissions offsets from around the world to support least cost emissions reductions across the economy.""

Coalition concerns

The Coalition hasn't laid out a firm plan on what it would do with the climate policy should it win the next election.

But it has been making a case for some time that change is needed.

Shadow Energy Minister Ted O'Brien addressed the Carbon Market Institute last year, and was asked about the future of the safeguard mechanism.

""My views, and the views of the Coalition were very clear at the time Labor introduced the safeguard mechanism — they hadn't done the work on how it's going to impact companies in that cohort,"" he said.

""We have seen a lot of that pain come through. A lot of them are very reliant on offsets, on [carbon credits], and we're not seeing a sufficiently active [carbon credit] market.

""We are seeing assets of those companies being written down. I do not believe it is working as the government intended.""

Peter Dutton was asked about climate policy and the safeguard mechanism at a press conference last month, but didn't directly address his plans for the emissions-capping tool.

""Our policy is that we want renewables in the system and we support renewables, as you saw when we were in government, we put a lot of money into projects and created an environment where significant projects are now a reality,"" he said.

""But we can't pretend for any longer that the batteries are going to see us through the hours of darkness, or over a week of rain.""

Energy Minister Chris Bowen argues the safeguard mechanism is working well, and there is little case for change.

""It's working as intended,"" he said.

""It's safeguarding the future of Australian industry to ensure that Australian industry can compete in a decarbonising world.""

Climate groups call for continuity

Advocates for work on climate change argue that if there is a case for change to the safeguard mechanism, it should be strengthening rather than weakening the tool.

John Connor from the Carbon Markets Institute says given the Coalition is committed to cutting emissions, he can't say why they would want to radically change it.

""It is important to understand that the safeguard mechanism was developed by the Coalition,"" he said.

""It [now] aligns with what are bipartisan targets of net zero emissions by 2050, and so it's linked to promises and positions that we are pleased to see Peter Dutton and others still continue to support, like net zero.""

He argues the reason business groups support certainty when it comes to policies like the safeguard mechanism is they are trying to make long-term investment decisions.

Companies are trying to plan for the emissions reductions they need to make under the mechanism in the years ahead.

""It is very important to understand the declines that they have to deliver compound each year,"" he said.

""And so it's actually about sending an investment signal.

""These are big emitters, big industrial facilities. And so we need some certainty.""

Others say whoever takes office needs to look at expanding the safeguard mechanism to capture more big emitters, and strengthen it to ensure cuts to pollution are actually being made.

Currently the safeguard mechanism captures those emitting more than 100,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide each year, and doesn't capture individual electricity generators (like coal-fired power plants).

Ben McLeod from the Climate Council says there are real opportunities for change.

""The next safeguard mechanism review must be about delivering more genuine, on-site reductions to industrial pollution,"" he said.

""We need to see stronger rules that make polluters clean up their own mess, rather than paying to delay action. That means shifting away from offsets and requiring real, permanent cuts at the source.

""We also need to bring more polluting facilities into the scheme, including electricity generators, so that all big polluters in Australia play by the same basic rules.""",australia-carbon-tax,abc.txt
"A carbon tax can have economic, not just environmental benefits for Australia",Mona Mashhadi Rajabi,https://theconversation.com/a-carbon-tax-can-have-economic-not-just-environmental-benefits-for-australia-210380,"August 2, 2023 3:59pm EDT","A new study has found that a carbon tax, accompanied by “revenue recycling”, can produce both environmental and economic benefits for Australia. 

Revenue recycling means money reaped from a carbon tax would be redirected back into the economy. This means the money accumulated from the tax would be redistributed between different stakeholders in the economy without increasing the government’s revenue.

To be more specific, the tax income should be used to support consumption, invest in new research and development projects, and subsidise energy saving and pollution reducing programs. Using this approach makes the tax more politically appealing to companies and other opponents.

Australia’s experience with a carbon tax 
Debate about a carbon tax has always been heated in Australia. The Gillard government introduced a carbon pricing scheme in 2012 which involved an initial rate of $23 per tonne on about 500 big carbon emitters, including the electricity industry.

The scheme contained compensation measures including increases in money to government payment recipients and a program to help emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries reduce carbon emissions, which were themselves a form of recycling.

Despite reducing emissions, the tax only lasted two years before it was terminated by the Abbott government, which argued the tax was costing big companies and causing electricity prices to rise.

I examined how such a scheme could work again, basing the design on the models used in Norway, Ireland and Switzerland. I simulated Australia’s economy from 2020 to 2035 to examine the impact of a carbon tax policy with the associated revenue recycling approach on prices, total emissions and economic growth.

The first step in the design is identifying a tax rate and the reach of the policy. Research shows that a uniform rate covering the whole industry sector generates the greatest environmental benefits.

As well as suggesting a uniform tax rate on all sectors including the electricity sector (which is excluded from the current emissions safeguard mechanism), my study recommends starting the tax rate at $23 (the same rate applied in Gillard’s scheme) in 2023 and increasing it gradually to $70 in 2030.

The rate would stay at this level until 2035.

A carbon tax increases the cost of production and leads to an increase in the inflation rate. The inflation impact of this policy is estimated to be 0.5% in 2023, increasing substantially to 1.52% in 2035.

Rising inflation reduces the spending power of families and reduces consumption and economic growth. Considering consumption has a fundamental role in a growing economy, the accumulated tax revenue would be used to keep consumption unchanged after implementing a carbon tax.

How a new version of the tax would work 
My study recommends using the accumulated carbon tax revenue to lower income taxes. This would leave more money for families, thereby reducing the impact of inflation, caused by the tax, on the economy.

As well as strengthening families’ spending power, a share of the tax revenue would be invested in research and development projects. This would create new jobs and provide a baseline for a prosperous economy.

My study recommends that in the first year, all the tax revenue would be used to support consumption. However, the amount of money allotted to investment would rise from the second year as the carbon tax rate increases. It is estimated that about $57 billion would be available for new technologies over 13 years under this carbon tax.

Imposing a carbon tax would also provide a financial incentive for industry to reduce its fossil fuel use. It would motivate the sector to shift to low-carbon technologies as they would bear a smaller tax bill and reap larger profits.

My study concludes Australia could reduce carbon emissions by 35% while GDP would increase by 0.286% by 2035 and new jobs would be created in research and development. Following the recommended carbon tax design, Australia’s transition to a low-carbon economy would be accelerated, which would benefit both the economy and the environment.",australia-carbon-tax,conversation.txt
Trump and Elon Musk trade insults and accusations as public feud reaches new heights,Kathryn Watson,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-german-chancellor-merz-meeting-white-house-today-2025-06-05/,"June 5, 2025","Washington — The relationship between President Trump and Elon Musk broke down in dramatic and public fashion on Thursday, with the president threatening to cancel Musk's lucrative government contracts and Musk claiming that Mr. Trump could not have won the presidency without him, fueling a feud that erupted over Musk's opposition to Republicans' tax and budget bill.

In the afternoon, Musk dropped what he called ""the really big bomb,"" alleging that Mr. Trump's name appeared in the files related to the case of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died by suicide in federal custody in 2019 while facing charges of sex trafficking. ""@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,"" Musk wrote on X. ""Have a nice day, DJT!""

Trump officials vowed to unveil more files related to the Epstein case when the administration took power. In February, the Justice Department issued a limited release of unredacted versions of files that had been public for years, a move that was met with criticism by conservatives who have demanded more transparency.

Mr. Trump soon responded with another post of his own: ""I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.""

Musk also expressed support for a post that said Mr. Trump should be impeached and replaced by Vice President JD Vance.

The break between the president and the world's richest man originated over Musk's ongoing criticism of Republicans' ""big, beautiful bill"" on Capitol Hill, which cuts taxes by trillions of dollars and implements Mr. Trump's domestic agenda, including cutting hundreds of billions of dollars in spending. Musk has railed against the legislation as ""outrageous"" and ""a disgusting abomination."" The Congressional Budget Office estimated on Wednesday that the bill would lead to an increase of $2.4 trillion in total deficits over the next 10 years, a conclusion that Republicans and Mr. Trump dispute.

""This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,"" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Thursday evening. ""The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.""

""I'm very disappointed in Elon""
The president was asked about Musk's criticism for the first time publicly during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office earlier Thursday.

""Elon and I had a great relationship,"" Mr. Trump told reporters. ""I don't know if we will anymore.""

Mr. Trump said Musk, the CEO of Tesla, was around for the whole process of crafting the bill. The president claimed he ""never had a problem"" with the legislation until provisions dealing with electric vehicle subsidies were eliminated, threatening Tesla's business. The bill would roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, phasing out a tax break for clean energy vehicles.

""I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot,"" Mr. Trump told reporters, adding that Musk ""worked hard"" and did a ""good job.""

""And I'll be honest, I think he misses the place,"" the president continued. ""He's not the first. People leave my administration and they love us. And then, at some point, they miss it so badly. And some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile. I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it.""

""Without me, Trump would have lost the election""... ""Such ingratitude""
Appearing to respond to Mr. Trump's comments in real time, Musk wrote on X: ""Whatever. Keep the EV/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill."" In another post, he denied that he was aware of the details in the bill when it was crafted, writing that ""this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!""

""Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,"" Musk went on. ""Such ingratitude,"" he added.

Musk spent roughly $277 million to elect Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers last year.

""Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave""
Mr. Trump volleyed back with attacks on Truth Social, claiming that he asked Musk to leave his administration and upset him with the legislative proposal ending the tax credits for electric vehicles.

""Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!"" the president wrote.

Threats to ""terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts""
The president also threatened to cancel Musk's federal contracts, citing such a move as a cost-cutting measure.

""The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!"" Mr. Trump said.

SpaceX and Tesla get billions of dollars a year from federal contracts and other programs. Shares of Tesla plummeted following Mr. Trump's threat, dropping by as much as 18% in late trading.

Musk responded with a threat of his own, posting on X: ""In light of the President's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately."" NASA relies on SpaceX's Crew Dragon to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station. But Musk followed that comment a few hours later with another post saying, ""Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon.""

Vice President JD Vance, meanwhile, expressed support for Mr. Trump, saying on X late Thursday he is ""proud to stand beside him"" in a post that did not name Musk.

The president's comments expressing disappointment with Musk were a swift about-face. Less than a week ago, Mr. Trump gifted Musk a key to the White House as an expression of gratitude for his work with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk wrapped up his time in the federal government Friday, as he reached the maximum amount of days he could serve as a special government employee.

Mr. Trump said then that Musk was ""really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling.""

Musk's opposition has raised questions about whether Republicans can remain united around the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, but GOP leaders in Congress appeared undeterred Wednesday, as the Senate forged ahead on the legislation. Musk and House Speaker Mike Johnson are expected to speak Thursday about the bill's path forward.

Meeting with German chancellor takes a turn
Mr. Trump's comments about Musk came as Merz and the president met to discuss trade and tariffs, as well as Russia's war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East. But the part of the meeting that was open to the press was dominated by the questions about Musk.

""It's an honor to have you,"" Mr. Trump told the German leader, calling him a challenging negotiator but adding that he's a great representative for Germany.

It was their first in-person meeting since Merz, leader of Germany's center-right Christian Democratic Union party, won a parliamentary vote to become chancellor last month following an election in February.

Merz brought a gift for Mr. Trump to the White House — an original copy of the birth certificate belonging to Mr. Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Trump, in German and in English.

Mr. Trump's 50% tariffs on imports from the European Union are set to take effect July 9. The EU, which includes Germany, has said it's preparing ""countermeasures"" to hit back. The 50% tariffs were set to start June 1, but Mr. Trump delayed the heavy tariffs after speaking with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Twenty-seven nations make up the EU.

The Trump-Merz meeting also comes hours after the president signed a proclamation Wednesday banning foreign nationals from a dozen countries, including Afghanistan and Haiti.

Earlier in the day, Mr. Trump said he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about tariffs and trade for roughly 90 minutes Thursday morning. The president told reporters in the Oval Office Thursday that he's accepted Xi's invitation to visit China, and will go there with first lady Melania Trump ""at a certain point.""",musk-trump-feud,cbs.txt
Elon Musk–Donald Trump Feud,Various Wikipedia contributors,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elon_Musk%E2%80%93Donald_Trump_feud,June 2025,"Since June 2025, the businessman and former presidential advisor Elon Musk and U.S. president Donald Trump have been involved in a feud, primarily across Twitter and Truth Social. The dispute began following Musk's exit from Trump's administration with his criticisms of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a bill intended to be landmark legislation for Trump.[1]

**Background**

**Musk and the second Trump administration**

In the 2024 United States presidential election, Elon Musk contributed over US$250 million to Donald Trump's presidential campaign.[2] In the Trump administration, Musk led the Department of Government Efficiency in an effort to dramatically restructure the federal bureaucracy.[3] He served as a special government employee, limiting his tenure to 130 days.[4]

Musk played a prominent role in campaigning during the 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court election, spending at least US$23 million through political action committees. His role in the election was a political liability for Brad Schimel.[5] At the Qatar Economic Forum in May 2025, Musk said that he would scale back political spending.[6] Musk told investors in Tesla that he would devote greater attention to his companies in April.[7] The following month, Musk left the Trump administration in a farewell ceremony.[8] Immediately after reporters left the Oval Office, Trump confronted Musk over political donations made to Democrats by Jared Isaacman, a Musk ally who was Trump's nominee administrator of NASA. Trump informed Isaacman hours later that his nomination was being withdrawn.[9]

**Musk's criticisms**

After the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, drafted by Trump and the Republican Party, passed the House of Representatives, Musk criticized it for increasing the deficit by US$1.5 trillion. Notably, he initially refrained from criticizing Trump himself.[8] In June, Musk told CBS News Sunday Morning that the bill would reverse the Department of Government Efficiency's work.[10]

**Events**

On June 5, 2025, Trump met with German chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office. During the meeting, Trump stated that he ""had a great relationship"" with Musk,[11] that he was ""disappointed"" in Musk for criticizing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,[12] that he would have won the state of Pennsylvania in the 2024 presidential election without Musk and that he was critical of the bill over its cuts to electric vehicle subsidies rather than the national debt it would incur,[13] and that Musk missed being in the White House, comparing him to former aides who became critical of Trump after leaving his administration.[14]

In response to Trump's comment that Musk ""knew the inner workings of the bill better than anybody"" in the room, Musk said on the social media site X that he did not have the opportunity to read the bill.[15] Musk, responding to Trump in real-time,[15] said that Trump had ""ingratitude"" and would have lost the election if not for his political activities.[8] Musk's posts included pointing out old posts from Trump chastising increases to the national debt, mockingly suggesting in one post that Trump was replaced by a ""body double"".[16] He rejected Trump's claim that he began criticizing the bill after efforts to remove cuts for electric vehicle subsidies failed.[17] Musk suggested that Trump was in the ""Epstein files"", the United States government's information on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.[18]

According to The New York Times, Musk unfollowed the X accounts of Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy and his homeland security advisor, as well as Charlie Kirk, a conservative influencer; the two men appeared on Kirk's show to praise the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.[19] Hours later, Trump wrote on Truth Social that Musk went ""CRAZY"" after the ""EV Mandate"" was purportedly taken away.[20] He then threatened to cut Musk's government contracts.[21] That evening, Musk called for Trump's impeachment.[22]

That night, Politico reported that Musk and Trump were scheduled to be on a call to reconcile. Responding to the hedge fund manager Bill Ackman's plea for the men to ""make peace for the benefit of our great country"", Musk said that he was ""not wrong.""[23] The following day, the White House stated that no call was planned.[24] The White House later said that Trump was selling the red Tesla Model S he received from Musk.[25] Trump told ABC News that Musk had ""lost his mind"" and that he was not interested in speaking to Musk,[26] and repeating in a CNN interview he won’t be speaking to him in the near future.[27] According to Bloomberg News, Trump aides signaled that Trump was moving on and that he would not cancel Musk's government contracts.[28] The New York Times later reported that Trump attributed Musk's apparent ""crazy"" behavior to his alleged drug use.[29]

**Effects**

**Political**

In one post, Musk suggested creating a political party to represent the ""eighty percent in the middle"".[30] The New York Times wrote that the feud poses implications for the ""Tech Right"", a group of conservative entrepreneurs, including individuals who work for Trump,[31] as well as risking US$100 million in political donations to Trump-affiliated organizations that Musk was set to give.[32] The proposed name for the party by Musk himself was ""The America Party"".[33]

Musk suggested that he would affect the electoral standing of lawmakers who did not support him in a post on Twitter.[34] The dispute did not appear to affect the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.[35]

**Economic**

Shares in Tesla, Inc. fell fifteen percent, its worst day since the COVID-19 pandemic.[36] Trading volumes for Tesla put options exceeded four million contracts, the highest on record.[37] Accoring to S3 Partners, short sellers accrued a cumulative US$4 billion; Tesla became the second-most shorted stock in the U.S. by total value.[38] The fall in Tesla's share price brought consumer discretionary stocks to their worst day since April.[39] Trump Media & Technology Group shares fell eight percent after Musk insinuated that Trump was in the Epstein files.[40] Trump's cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, additionally fell twelve percent.[41] The feud cost Musk US$34 billion.[42]

According to The Wall Street Journal, the feud raised hopes from advertisers that litigation against companies that have refused to advertise on X would be eased, owing to lessened political weight.[43] The dispute threatened a US$5 billion debt sale for Musk's xAI.[44]

**Government**

Steve Bannon, a former advisor to Trump, said that he was urging Trump to cancel government contracts with his companies and to investigate Musk's immigration status, his alleged drug use, and his apparent efforts to attend a classified briefing on a possible war between China and Taiwan.[45] After Bannon called for Trump to seize SpaceX with an executive order, Musk referred to him as a ""communist retard"".[46] Democratic representatives Stephen Lynch and Robert Garcia sent a letter to attorney general Pam Bondi and Federal Bureau of Investigation director Kash Patel inquiring about Musk's allegation that Trump was present in government files on Epstein.[47]

On X, Musk stated that SpaceX was decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft, necessary to the operations of the International Space Station.[22] He backed down a few hours later.[48]

**Responses**

**Domestic**

On social media, comparisons between the feud and that in Mean Girls (2004), as well as the Drake–Kendrick Lamar feud, were made. The livestreamer Hasan Piker said that Musk should ""pull up"" to his podcast to infuriate Trump.[49]

The dissolution of Musk and Trump's relationship was praised by some Make America Great Again followers.[50] A YouGov survey indicated that most Republicans support Trump in the feud, while most Democrats were neutral.[51]

Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer referenced ""Bad Blood"", a song by Taylor Swift believed to be about her feud with Katy Perry. House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries referred to the feud as a ""GOP civil war"". The Democratic Party's X account called to ""KILL THE BILL AND RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!""[52] On War Room, Steve Bannon warned that Musk could be ""flipped"" by Democrats.[53] Representative Ro Khanna argued that Democrats should court Musk.[54]

**International**

Russian internet users compared the feud to the Wagner Group–Russian Ministry of Defence conflict, a dispute between Russia's Ministry of Defence and the oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin that led to the Wagner Group rebellion. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the Security Council, joked that he was willing to broker a truce between Musk and Trump.[55]

Trump's focus on Musk during his meeting with Friedrich Merz was met with relief from several German commentators, who noted caustic meetings with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and South African president Cyril Ramaphosa.[56]",musk-trump-feud,wikipedia.txt
Trump-Musk split could leave Tesla politically homeless,David Ferris,https://www.politico.com/news/2025/06/06/musk-trump-split-could-leave-tesla-homeless-00391039,06/06/2025 10:21 AM EDT,"The spectacular breakup between Elon Musk and President Donald Trump threatens to leave Tesla with few political friends.

Musk has spent the past few months alienating the electric automaker’s base of climate-minded car buyers by moonlighting as Trump’s government-slasher-in-chief. Now, the billionaire’s fixation on the GOP megabill has opened a dangerous rift with the president, who threatened Thursday to end all subsidies to Musk’s companies.

Tesla’s stock had its largest one-day drop in history Thursday as Musk and Trump sniped at each other from their respective social media platforms. The share price fell more than 14 percent, lopping off more than $150 billion from Tesla’s market value — and, according to Bloomberg, tanking Musk’s personal net worth by $34 billion.

The core of the argument between the two men — whether the Republican spending package is a “big, beautiful bill” or a “MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK” — is a side concern for people whose main priority is Tesla.

“The CEO of that company needs to spend his time focused on the company’s success,” said Nick Nigro, the head of Atlas Public Policy, which analyzes the electric vehicle market. “Whether his interest in federal policy comes from a good place, it’s a distraction from what Tesla shareholders and drivers need, which is his full attention.”

Seth Abramson, a vociferous Musk critic who is writing a book about the entrepreneur, wrote on X that “Musk will go the rest of his life without a political home or patron, shunned by politicians of both parties and therefore unable to effectively operate as a CEO of any company.”

The breakup between the world’s richest man and one of its most powerful could have far-reaching impacts for Musk’s companies.

Investor optimism about Tesla has been based on the assumption that Musk’s proximity to power would lead to a national policy on autonomous vehicles that would ease the arrival of Tesla’s robotaxi, which is supposed to hit the roads of Austin, Texas, this month. Musk could also lose leverage on other issues important to Tesla, such as Trump’s tariffs on China’s critical minerals. Meanwhile, his space company SpaceX has billions of dollars of federal defense and space contracts — now at risk — while its satellite subsidiary Starlink is angling for billions more in federal broadband subsidies.

‘Attack mode’

Tesla is still the country’s largest electric automaker. But the Trump-Musk split comes at a vulnerable moment for both Tesla and electric vehicles writ large.

The company is facing declining sales around the world, as its vehicle lineup has grown stale and Musk’s political activities have turned off many EV buyers in Europe and North America.

Meanwhile, federal support for EVs is hanging by a thread. The House’s version of the megabill would drastically scale back Biden-era tax incentives meant to stimulate EV manufacturing and sales.

The fight between Trump and Musk escalated on Thursday after Trump told reporters that Musk was “upset” about the House-passed bill’s proposal to remove EV tax credits and other incentives. Musk took to X to deny that narrative, writing: “Keep the EV/solar incentives cuts in the bill, also cut all the crazy spending increases in the Big Ugly Bill so that America doesn’t go bankrupt!”

The president’s repeated attacks on EVs and vows to repeal the Biden administration’s subsidies certainly didn’t seem to trouble Musk much during last year’s campaign, when the megabillionaire spent more than $270 million and countless hours to help put Trump back into the White House. (Trump did concede at the time that Tesla made a “great product.”)

Musk’s apparent willingness to sacrifice federal incentives was unwelcome news to clean energy and EV advocates who hope Republican senators will save some of the tax credits from the Democrats’ 2022 climate law. Republicans can afford to lose only three votes in the Senate, and some GOP senators have indicated they think the bill’s rollbacks go too far.

The war of words between Trump and Musk ended any hopes that the Tesla CEO would have the leverage with the White House to tip the scales.

“Elon was ‘wearing thin,’ I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!” Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social.

That statement was a far cry from three months ago, when Trump made a show of buying a Tesla in front of the White House. That gesture raised hopes among some Tesla shareholders that Republicans would embrace Tesla and compensate for its diminished popularity among Democrats, many of whom had taken to staging protests outside its showrooms.

“I’m going to buy because No. 1, it’s a great product, as good as it gets. And No. 2, because this man has devoted his energy and his life to doing this, I think he’s been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people,” Trump said at the time about Musk.

Now, that’s all changed.

“Trump no longer has to say nice things about Tesla and EVs,” said Loren McDonald, an analyst at the EV data shop Paren, in a message. “He and the admin can go back to ‘EVs are evil’ attack mode.”

Critical minerals and beyond

The fizzled bromance could also alter the myriad and complex relationships that Tesla has across the globe, as well as its business before the federal government.

Musk, for example, will presumably hold no sway over the administration’s intended move to impose steep tariffs on imports of Chinese graphite used to make EV batteries.

The Commerce Department concluded last month that imported Chinese graphite is receiving unfair subsidies. The agency laid out a plan to impose tariffs of up to 721 percent on some natural and artificial graphite active anode material from China that’s used in batteries.

Tesla has fought against the tariffs, with one of the company’s attorneys pointing out that U.S. manufacturers don’t yet produce anode material that meets carmakers’ standards.

The fallout could also put a bulls-eye on Musk’s financial ties to Beijing, something Democrats have repeatedly railed against.

The Trump administration and lawmakers from both parties are pushing to ease China’s grip on supply chains, from the production of critical minerals to processing and manufacturing of EV batteries.

Yet Tesla has many ties to China, including reliance on graphite imports, a gigafactory located in Shanghai, and ongoing work with Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. CATL, the world’s largest battery-maker, is on a U.S. government list of companies that work with the Chinese military.

In short, nothing on Thursday boded well for America’s leading electric automaker.

“It’s another Twilight Zone moment in this Musk/Trump relationship which now is quickly moving downhill,” wrote Dan Ives, an analyst at investment shop Wedbush Securities who tracks Tesla.

But Ives nonetheless remained hopeful. The subject line of his email: “Friends Again Soon?”

From bros to foes: how the unlikely Trump-Musk relationship imploded,Nandita Bose and Jeff Mason,https://www.reuters.com/world/us/bros-foes-how-unlikely-trump-musk-relationship-imploded-2025-06-06/,"June 6, 2025","When Donald Trump met privately with White House officials on Wednesday, there was little to suggest that the U.S. president was close to a public break with Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman who helped him win a second term in office. Two White House officials familiar with the matter said Trump expressed confusion and frustration in the meeting about Musk's attacks on his sweeping tax and spending bill. But he held back, the officials said, because he wanted to preserve Musk's political and financial support ahead of the 2026 midterm election. 

By Thursday afternoon, Trump's mood had shifted. He had not spoken to Musk since the attacks began and was fuming over what one White House aide described as a ""completely batshit"" tirade by the Tesla CEO on X, his social media platform. On Friday, a White House official said Trump was not interested in talking to Musk and no phone call between the two men was planned for the day. Musk had blasted Trump's tax bill as fiscally reckless and a ""disgusting abomination."" He vowed to oppose any Republican lawmaker who supported it. The bill would fulfill many of Trump's priorities while adding, according to the Congressional Budget Office, $2.4 trillion to the $36.2-trillion U.S. public debt.

Privately, Trump had called Musk volatile. On Thursday, he told his team, it was time to take the gloves off. Sitting next to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters he was ""very disappointed"" in his former adviser. Musk quickly hit back on social media, and the back-and-forth devolved from there. ""The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's government subsidies and contracts,"" Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media site. Within minutes, Musk said it might be time to create a new political party and endorsed a post on X from Ian Miles Cheong, a prominent Musk supporter and right-wing activist, calling for Trump's impeachment.

The depth of the Trump-Musk relationship at its height was unprecedented in Washington - a sitting president granting a billionaire tech CEO access and influence inside the White House and throughout his government. Musk spent nearly $300 million backing Trump's campaign and other Republicans last year. For months, Musk played both insider and disruptor - shaping policy conversations behind the scenes, amplifying Trump's agenda to millions online, and attacking the bureaucracy and federal spending through his self-styled Department of Government Efficiency. Just last week, Trump hosted a farewell for Musk and declared that ""Elon is really not leaving."" Now he had not only left but had turned into a top critic. Hours after Trump's Oval Office remarks, a third White House official expressed surprise at Musk's turnaround. It ""caught the president and the entire West Wing off guard,"" she said. Musk did not respond to emails seeking comment about the downturn in relations. His super PAC spending group, America PAC, and spokeswoman Katie Miller did not respond to calls and texts requesting comment.

In a statement, the White House called the breakup an ""unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted."" The Musk-Trump breakup sent Tesla's stock price plunging 14% on Thursday and drove uncertainty among Trump's allies in Congress, who are working to pass the monumental spending package that Democrats and a small number of vocal Republicans oppose. Tesla shares clawed back from steep losses on Friday. 

The breakup could reshape both men's futures. For Trump, losing Musk's backing threatens his growing influence among tech donors, social media audiences, and younger male voters — key groups that may now be harder to reach. It could also complicate fundraising ahead of next year's midterm elections. For Musk, the stakes are potentially even higher. The break risks intensified scrutiny of his business practices that could jeopardize government contracts and invite regulatory probes, which might threaten his companies' profits. Some of Musk's friends and associates were stunned by the fallout, with a number of them only recently expressing confidence that the partnership would endure, according to two other sources familiar with the dynamics. The split had been simmering for weeks, said the first two White House officials, but the breaking point was over personnel: Trump's decision to pull his nomination of Jared Isaacman, Musk's hand-picked candidate to be NASA administrator. ""He was not happy"" about Isaacman, one of the White House officials said of Musk.

Isaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur and close Musk ally, was seen as key to advancing Musk's vision for space exploration and commercial space ventures. After his nomination was scuttled, Isaacman posted on X: ""I am incredibly grateful to President Trump, the Senate and all those who supported me."" The move was viewed within the administration as a direct snub to Musk, the two officials said, signaling a loss of political clout and deepening the rift between him and Trump's team. Before the Isaacman episode, top White House aides behind the scenes had already begun limiting Musk's influence — quietly walking back his authority over staffing and budget decisions. Trump himself reinforced that message in early March, telling his cabinet that department secretaries, not Musk, had the final say over agency operations. At the same time, Musk began to hint that his time in government would come to a close, while expressing frustration at times that he could not more aggressively cut spending. 

His threats and complaints about Trump's bill grew louder, but inside the White House, few believed they would seriously alter the course of the legislation — even as some worried about the fallout on the midterms from Musk's warnings to cut political spending, the first two White House officials said. Still, a fourth White House official dismissed the impact of Musk's words on the president's signature bill. ""We're very confident,"" he said. ""No one has changed their minds."" But there was bafflement at the White House at how a relationship that only last week had been celebrated in the Oval Office had taken such a turn. Time will tell whether the rift can be repaired.",musk-trump-feud,reuters.txt
Trump and Musk Split,Spencer Neale,https://www.theamericanconservative.com/trump-and-musk-split/,"Jun 5, 2025","The relationship between President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk collapsed in spectacular fashion on Thursday. 

As Trump met with the Chancellor of Germany Friedrich Merz at the White House Thursday afternoon, Musk posted a battery of tweets to his social media platform X criticizing Trump’s “Big Beautiful” spending bill.

“The Big Ugly Bill will INCREASE the deficit to $2.5 trillion!” warned Musk. 

“In the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful,” read another missive. “Either you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill. Slim and beautiful is the way.”

Musk also reshared years-old tweets from Trump in an effort to highlight the president’s alleged hypocrisy.  

“I cannot believe the Republicans are extending the debt ceiling—I am a Republican & I am embarrassed!” Trump wrote in January of 2013. Those words are at odds with Trump’s most recent position on the debt ceiling. The 47th president said on Wednesday that he was “very pleased to announce” that he agrees with longtime Democratic rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has called for the debt ceiling to be scrapped. “Wise words,” Musk replied sarcastically to Trump’s 2013 post.

Musk escalated his rhetoric as Trump finished his meeting with Merz. Musk said Trump was guilty of “ingratitude” and suggested the 47th president could not have won the 2024 election without his financial assistance. “Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,” wrote Musk. The DOGE man then created a poll which asked X users if he should form “a new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?” The poll received more than 3 million votes by Thursday evening with more than 80% of respondents voting in support of Musk’s idea. 

Responding on Truth Social, Trump said he “asked Musk to leave” his administration because the tech titan was “wearing thin.” Trump added, “I took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted… and he just went CRAZY!” 

The president wasn’t finished. In a separate post to Truth, Trump threatened Musk’s business by suggesting the “easiest way to save money on the Budget” is “to terminate Elon’s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.”

The stock price of Tesla collapsed following the threat, finishing almost 15 percent down on the day and erasing more than $150 billion in market cap from the carmaker, marking the company’s biggest daily loss in history. It was amid the Tesla sell off that Musk fired off what he called “the really big bomb,” accusing Trump of being “in the Epstein files.”

“That is the real reason they have not been made public,” Musk stated. “Have a nice day, DJT!” Adding fuel to the fire, Musk later suggested that Trump be impeached and that Vice President J.D. Vance be made president instead. 

In retaliation to the series of tweets, Trump ally Steve Bannon called Musk an “illegal” and said the South African tech magnate should be deported from the United States “immediately.”

Writing on Truth Social late Thursday evening, Trump seemed to lower the temperature. 

“I don’t mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago,” Trump wrote. “This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress. It’s a Record Cut in Expenses, $1.6 Trillion Dollars, and the Biggest Tax Cut ever given. If this Bill doesn’t pass, there will be a 68% Tax Increase, and things far worse than that. I didn’t create this mess, I’m just here to FIX IT.”",musk-trump-feud,american-conservative.txt
Excitement as Two New Pandas Arrive in US from China,Brendan Smialowski / AFP,https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2024/10/15/excitement-as-two-new-pandas-arrive-in-us-from-china,15 Oct 2024,"China has sent two giant panda bears to the United States to be housed in Washington, DC’s Smithsonian National Zoo, in a rare diplomatic overture between the two countries.

The three-year-old pandas – a male named Bao Li and a female named Qing Bao – arrived at Virginia’s Dulles International Airport, which serves the US capital, on Tuesday.

They are among a small handful of the black-and-white bears still in the US, which sent most of the highly sought animals back to their native China in recent years under pre-arranged contracts. That includes the return last November of the only three pandas living in Washington’s National Zoo.

Many viewed the absence of a quick replacement for the three pandas as reflective of growing US-China friction, but Chinese President Xi Jinping soon promised he would send new pandas as “envoys of friendship”.

In August, the San Diego Zoo welcomed two new giant pandas, the first to arrive in the US in 21 years.

Anticipation over the arrival of the two new pandas in Washington, DC, has been high, with the zoo’s website featuring a banner that reads: “The pandas are coming”.

“The giant pandas are an iconic part of the Washington, DC story, both for locals and incoming travellers alike,” said Elliott L Ferguson, II, president and CEO of Destination DC. “The interest and excitement associated with their return directly benefits the entire city, bringing further interest and visitors to our hotels, restaurants and other attractions.”

The National Zoo has been renovating its panda habitat ahead of the new bears’ arrival, setting up new shallow pools and bamboo stands.

The pandas will not be available to the public for more than a month as they quarantine and acclimate to their new habitat.

China has been using so-called “panda diplomacy” since 1972, when the first animals were sent to Washington as a gift, following US President Richard Nixon’s historic visit to China.

Later, a rolling series of 10-year cooperation agreements was struck, which Chinese Embassy spokesperson Liu Pengyu credited with advancing research in panda preservation.

“The current round of cooperation will focus on prevention and treatment of major diseases, and protection of habitats and wild giant panda populations,” Liu told the Associated Press via email. “We hope the arrival of the pandas will inject fresh impetus into exchanges between China and the US, and help to stabilise the broader bilateral relationship as well.”

As of 2014, there were around 1,860 giant pandas in the wild, a 17 percent increase from the decade before, according to the World Wildlife Fund (WWF). In 2021, Chinese conservationists reclassified the animal from an endangered species to one that is vulnerable.

Panda diplomacy,Wikipedia contributors,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Panda_diplomacy,Accessed October 2023,"Panda diplomacy (Chinese: 熊猫外交) is the practice of sending giant pandas from China to other countries as a tool of diplomacy and wildlife conservation.\[1] From 1941 to 1984, the Chinese government gifted pandas to other countries. Since 1984, they have been leased rather than gifted due to a PRC policy change.

History

Pre-1950s
While there are few ancient records of the giant panda, ""During the Manchu dynasty skins of this animal \[bei-shung, presumed to be the panda] were sent as tribute to the government of China by the aborigines of western Szechuan and eastern Tibet"", according to David Crockett Graham.\[2]: 25 \[3]: 19 

Madam Chiang and John Tee-Van of the Bronx Zoo, USA, with the baby Panda in Madam Chiang's yard in Chongqing, November 9, 1941.
The first instance of panda diplomacy in the modern era was arranged by Soong Mei-ling (Madame Chiang) in 1941. China was under siege by Japan, the U.S. had been sending aid to the Kuomintang (Nationalist Government) in China, and Madame Chiang wanted a dramatic way of saying thank you. There had been previous pandas sent to the U.S., including one named Su Lin sold to the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago by Ruth Harkness in 1937, a second one named Mei-Mei brought back by Harkness in 1938 and also sold to the Brookfield Zoo,\[4] one named Pandora sent to the Bronx Zoo by David Crockett Graham in 1938, and a second named Pan sent to the Bronx Zoo in 1939.\[2]: 92  Besides the two live Pandas sent to the Bronx Zoo, Graham had also collected several skins and skeletons that were sent to the Smithsonian.\[5]: 55 

In the summer of 1941, Madame Chiang enlisted David Crockett Graham to capture a live panda. Eventually, two were caught. After spending some time at Graham's house in Chengdu, they were brought to Chongqing for a formal handover to a representative of the Bronx Zoo. William J. Dunn, a CBS radio reporter, was in Chongqing at the time and was enlisted to emcee the ceremony, which would air on both radio XGOY \[zh], ""The Voice of China,"" and CBS Radio. To ensure the program aired during prime time in the U.S., it originated from Chongquing at 4 a.m. local time.\[6]: 59–60  Annalee Whitmore, then working as publicity manager for United China Relief, interviewed the participants and wrote the transcript.\[7]: 198–200  The broadcast was to include Madame Chiang, her sister Soong Ai-ling (Madame Kung), David Crockett Graham, and John Tee-Van from the Bronx Zoo. The plan was to transmit the XGOY signal to an RCA communications centre in Manila and then on to San Francisco; however, on the morning of November 9, 1941, the engineers were unable to confirm reception from Manila. The broadcast began as planned, but atmospheric conditions prevented the broadcast from reaching the United States.\[6]: 60 

The pandas were flown to Hong Kong under cover of night and from there to the Philippines on Pan Am's Hong Kong Clipper. From there, they took a circuitous six-week route by ship to San Francisco. Unfortunately, while they were en route, Pearl Harbor was bombed;\[2]: 95–97  and, when they arrived in San Francisco in late December 1941, front-page news was all about war. While the pandas did get attention, they weren't at the top of the news across the nation as had been hoped.\[8] The bears were officially received by the Bronx Zoo on December 30, 1941, and five months later, following a national contest, they were named Pan-dee and Pan-dah.\[9]

Post-1950s
While the Republic of China used giant pandas for diplomatic means as early as 1941,\[10] The People's Republic of China began to use panda diplomacy more prominently in the 1950s and has continued the practice into the present day. Between 1957 and 1983, 24 pandas were given as gifts to 9 nations as gestures of friendship. These nations included the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom.\[11]

U.S. First Lady Pat Nixon viewing the Beijing Zoo panda exhibit in February 1972
When President Nixon visited China in 1972, Mao Zedong promised to send two pandas to an American zoo. In exchange, Nixon gave two musk oxen to the Chinese as a gift. The mutual gifts illustrated the growing diplomatic relationship between China and the United States at the time.\[12] Despite the long history of panda diplomacy, the arrival of the pandas in 1972 marked the first time a panda had been in the United States in over twenty years.\[11]

Upon the pandas' arrival in April 1972, First Lady Pat Nixon donated them to the National Zoo in Washington, D.C., where she welcomed them in an official ceremony. Over 20,000 people visited the pandas the first day they were on display, and an estimated 1.1 million visitors came to see them the first year they were in the United States.\[13] The pandas were wildly popular and China's gift was seen as an enormous diplomatic success, evidence of China's eagerness to establish official relations with the U.S.\[14] It was so successful that British Prime Minister Edward Heath asked for pandas for the United Kingdom during a visit to China in 1974. Pandas Chia-Chia and Ching-Ching arrived at the London Zoo a few weeks later.\[13] The pandas gifted to the UK would later be the inspiration for the logo of the World Wildlife Fund.\[11]

Mexico
One of the gifted pandas at Chapultepec Zoo, 24 July 1978
Mexico and the PRC established formal relations on 14 February 1972.\[15] On 10 September 1975,\[16] two pandas, Pe Pe (male) and Ying Ying (female), were gifted to Mexico as a sign of friendship by Mao Zedong following the April 1973 state visit to China by President Luis Echeverría. The pandas were delivered by Vicepremier of the State Council Chen Yonggui and received by First Lady María Esther Zuno.\[15] They were housed at Chapultepec Zoo. The zoo became the first institution outside China to successfully breed pandas.

In 1984, China shifted from panda gifts to a policy of high-priced loans. However, Mexico has retained ownership of the locally born pandas since their lineage traces to the gifted panda couple.\[citation needed]

In 1980, Pe Pe and Ying Ying had Xen Li, the first panda born outside China, however, she did not survive into adulthood. In 1983 the couple had Liang Liang. In 1985 Ying Ying gave birth to twins, an unnamed cub and Xiu Hua. In 1987, Ying Ying gave birth to another set of twins, Ping Ping and Shuan Shuan. In 1981 Ying Ying gave birth to Tohui, who in turn mothered Xin Xin (with Chia Chia, a gifted panda at the London Zoo). Xin Xin is the last living panda not owned by China.\[17]

Post-1984
In 1984, China's leader Deng Xiaoping modified the policy, such that subsequent pandas would be leased, instead of gifted, beginning with China presenting two pandas to Los Angeles during the 1984 Olympic Games for \$50,000 per month per panda. This practice was again modified in 1991 in favour of long-term leases.\[18] China began to offer pandas to other nations only on ten-year lease. The standard lease terms include a fee of up to US\$1 million per year and a provision that any cubs born during the lease period be the property of the People's Republic of China. Since 1998, because of a World Wildlife Fund lawsuit, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service allows a U.S. Zoo to import a panda only if the zoo can ensure that China will channel more than half of its loan fee into conservation efforts for wild pandas and their habitat. The gifting of two pandas to Hong Kong in 2007 was ostensibly an exception to this lease model, but can be seen as outside of the spectrum of panda diplomacy.\[18]

After the 2008 Sichuan earthquake that severely damaged many facilities, 60 pandas required new housing. The majority were given to nations that had favourable trade agreements with China or those that supplied China with necessary resources, such as uranium from Australia.\[11]

Giant panda at the Taipei Zoo
In 2005, Lien Chan, Chairman of the Kuomintang, the then opposition party in Taiwan, visited mainland China. As part of the talks between Lien and the CCP, two pandas (later named Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, meaning ""reunion"" in Chinese) were offered as a gift to the people of Taiwan. While the idea was popular with the Taiwanese public\[citation needed], it was opposed by the Republic of China (ROC) government of Taiwan, then led by the Democratic Progressive Party (DPP), which opposes unification with the People's Republic of China. The gift of pandas was seen as an attempt by the CCP to draw the ROC government into its ""united front"". While several zoos in Taiwan made bids to host the pandas, the ROC government raised objections, ostensibly because pandas were not suited to the Taiwanese climate and Taiwan did not have the expertise to rear pandas successfully. It was widely understood, however, that these were pretexts underlaid by political considerations by the DPP-led government to maintain its distance from the PRC government.\[19]

Another technical issue is a dispute over the applicability of the Convention on the International Trade of Endangered Species (CITES). In 1998, China offered the Republic of China two giant pandas in exchange for wartime peace. The PRC insisted that a transfer from mainland China to Taiwan was a domestic transfer, not subject to CITES, while the ROC government disputed this and would not accept the pandas without CITES procedures.\[20] On March 11, 2006, the ROC formally rejected the offer, with President Chen Shui-bian explaining in his weekly newsletter, ""A-bian (Chen's nickname) sincerely urges the Chinese leaders to leave the giant pandas in their natural habitat because pandas brought up in cages or given as gifts will not be happy.""\[20]

Following a change of government in Taiwan, in July 2008, the ROC government led by the Kuomintang stated that it would accept the gift of two four-year-old giant pandas.\[21] In December 2008, the government approved the import of pandas under the terms of ""species of traditional herbal medicine.""\[22] Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan arrived at Taipei Zoo later in the same month. In response to the transfer, the CITES Secretariat stated that the transfer of the two pandas was a matter of ""internal or domestic trade"", and so was not required to be reported to CITES.\[23] The ROC quickly issued a rebuttal to the CITES statement and insisted that the country-to-country transfer protocols be respected. The ROC also noted that such procedures would not have been needed if it had been an internal/domestic transfer.\[24] The ROC further noted that Taiwan is not a CITES signatory and is therefore not obligated to report to the CITES Secretariat its acceptance of the two pandas.\[25]

In the 1970s, the Nixon administration sought to improve US-China relations. Shortly after Nixon visited China in 1972, Beijing sent two pandas, named Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing. The female died in 1992 from heart disease and the male was euthanized in 1999 after developing end-stage kidney disease. China has leased out subsequent pandas to the US; however, most of these leases have expired or are set to expire soon, with the National Zoo returning three giant pandas to China in November 2023.\[26]

In 2013, PRC officials used panda diplomacy in an attempt to scuttle a 2013 agricultural trade deal between Nebraska and Taiwan.\[27]

In the late 2010s and early 2020s, with China–United States relations straining, China began declining to renew panda leases for U.S. zoos.\[28]\[29] The San Diego Zoo pandas returned to China in 2019, followed by pandas at the Memphis Zoo and National Zoo in Washington, D.C. in 2023.\[30] The Memphis pandas, Ya Ya and Le Le, became a rallying point for Chinese calls to repatriate the bears after accusations of poor living conditions circulated on Chinese social media sites and the sudden death of Le Le in February 2023. A joint team of American and Chinese scientists concluded Ya Ya was suffering from skin disease due to genetic components and fluctuating hormones.\[31] The Zoo Atlanta pandas, the last giant pandas remaining in the United States, were returned to China in late 2024.\[32]\[33] Scholars, including Johns Hopkins University political economist Ho-fung Hung, have questioned whether a deterioration in US-China relations starting in the late 2010s brought an end to panda diplomacy between the two countries.\[34]

In a 2023 Washington Post opinion piece, Lonnie G. Bunch III and Ellen Stofan, secretary and undersecretary, respectively, of the Smithsonian Institution, called the return of the National Zoo's pandas ""a lesson in cultural diplomacy."" They wrote: ""Pandas are a vital source of cultural diplomacy — using the arts, science and history to help nations find common ground with the hopes of building on our shared humanity to create a more peaceful world. The pandas were a bridge between the American people and the Chinese people."" They concluded: ""If we can save this iconic species, then surely, we can work together to tackle some of our greatest challenges, including climate change and preservation of ecosystems around the world.""\[35]

In February 2024, the China Wildlife Conservation Association announced plans to send a new pair of pandas to the San Diego Zoo as early as summer 2024, nearly five years after the Zoo returned its pandas to China.\[36]\[37] These pandas, who are named Yun Chuan and Xin Bao, arrived in late June 2024 and debuted to the public on August 8, 2024.\[38] The same year, London Breed traveled to China in an attempt to procure pandas for San Francisco.\[27]

In May 2024, the National Zoo announced that two pandas named Bao Li and Qing Bao would become part of the collection by the end of the year.\[39] The pandas arrived on October 15, 2024 and will be in quarantine to get acclimated to their new environment. They were shown to the public on January 24, 2025 after some preview days in mid-January with more limited audiences present.\[40]

Other nations
Other countries recognize the significance of pandas as diplomatic symbols, emblematic of the state of relations with China. During a visit by then Chinese Leader Hu Jintao to Japan in May 2008, China announced the lease of two pandas to Japan. The leader was quoted as saying ""Giant pandas are very popular among the Japanese, and they are a symbol of the friendly ties between Japan and China.""\[41] Treatment of the pandas is likewise associated with the relevant foreign policy. For example, in 1964, British diplomats worried that a transfer of a panda from a London Zoo to Moscow would worsen Sino–Soviet relations.\[42] In January 2006, U.S. Deputy Secretary of State Robert Zoellick was photographed hugging a five-month-old panda cub during his visit to Sichuan. The Chinese media widely broadcast the image and it was purportedly interpreted as a sign that Zoellick supported better relations between China and the United States.\[43]

On April 16, 2014, China planned to send a pair of pandas named Fu Wa and Feng Yi to Malaysia to mark their 40-year diplomatic ties but were postponed following the MH370 tragedy.\[44] The two pandas later arrived at Kuala Lumpur International Airport on May 21, 2014, and were placed at the National Zoo of Malaysia.\[45]\[46] In 2018, Finland agreed to care for two giant pandas following their endorsement of the one-China policy.\[47] They will be sent home in November 2024 due to their maintenance cost of 1.5 million a year and lack of government funding.\[48] Two pandas, Cai Tao and Hu Chun, arrived in Jakarta in 2017 to be placed in Taman Safari in Bogor as part of the 60th anniversary celebrations of China–Indonesia relations.\[49] The most recent panda lease was on June 5, 2019, when Chinese Communist Party (CCP) General Secretary Xi Jinping leased two giant pandas to Russia's Moscow Zoo on an official state visit as a ""sign of respect and trust."" The pandas include a two-year-old male Ru Yi and a one-year-old female Ding Ding.\[50]

In December 2023, the only giant pandas in the UK were sent back to China.\[51]

Practicalities
Keeping pandas is very expensive. Besides the ""rent"" payable to China, obtaining enough bamboo is very expensive. A panda typically consumes only fresh bamboo, eating 40 kilograms (88 lb) of it every day.\[52] It was reported in 2011 that Edinburgh Zoo spent \$107,000 per year to feed its two pandas.\[53] This caused the zoo to ask for bamboo donations, as well as for local gardeners to start growing bamboo.\[54] During the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply of bamboo added to cost considerations. Owing to the difficulty of securing a consistent and adequate supply of fresh bamboo, Calgary Zoo returned their pair of pandas ahead of schedule, to join their progeny back in China.\[52] Due to the high upkeep costs, pandas have been considered a white elephant gift.\[55]\[56]

In 2003, China sent Thailand a pair of pandas, Chuang Chuang and Lin Hui, to Chiang Mai Zoo. Chuang Chuang was put on a diet in 2007 due to obesity and died in September 2019 as a result of heart failure. The public started to blame this incident on China's panda diplomacy, with many arguing that sending the animals overseas and outside their endemic habitat was detrimental to their health, further exacerbating their population decline.\[57]\[58]

The one (relatively) consistent sign of goodwill between the countries? The pandas.

Pandas, those roly-poly, black-and-white stuffies come to life, are back in the United States and already delighting visitors to the Smithsonian's National Zoo as they frolic in the snow, gnaw on bamboo and generally add a bit of whimsy and joy to an otherwise frigid and foreboding January.

Three-year-old Bao Li (a male) and Qing Bao (a female) made their public debut at the zoo on Friday, months after their October arrival in Washington, D.C. from their home in Chengdu in the Sichuan province of China. They replaced Mei Xiang, Tian Tian, and their cub, Xiao Qi Ji, who returned to China when their lease expired in November 2023.

The interval between visiting pandas marked the first time that the National Zoo has been without pandas since 1972, when the first ""panda ambassadors"" came to the U.S. following a historic visit to China by then-President Richard Nixon.

Over the decades, relations between the two superpowers have ebbed and flowed, but panda diplomacy has, for the most part, been a consistent sign of goodwill between China and the United States, who've loaned and hosted, respectively, the gentle giants over the better part of the last 53 years.

Here's a quick look back at the history of panda diplomacy, particularly between the U.S. and China:

What is panda diplomacy and when did it start?
Panda diplomacy — China's practice of loaning its pandas to foreign zoos to build ties with other countries — is believed to have started in the 7th century, when the Tang Dynasty Empress Wu Zeitan sent bears (pandas are only found in southwest China, and are considered a national treasure there) to Japan, according to History.com.

Pandas as a World War II 'thank you'
As World War II was raging in Asia and Europe and the U.S. was still weighing whether to get involved, China sent a pair of pandas to the Bronx Zoo in New York as a gesture of thanks, according to History.com. Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong would also send pandas to its allies North Korea and the Soviet Union during the 1950s. United Press International's archives also include a story about pandas being sent to the Bronx Zoo in 1987.

Richard Nixon visits China; pandas come to the U.S.
In 1972, U.S. President Richard Nixon visited China, ending 25 years of tense relations between the two countries. Two months later, Nixon and his wife Pat welcomed Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling, two pandas gifted to the U.S. from China and its premier, Zhou Enlai. American zoos lobbied the White House to be able to host the pandas. Ultimately, the National Zoo became their temporary home.

They proved to be wildly popular attractions, according to the Nixon Presidential Library, with more than 20,000 people clamoring to see the pandas on their public debut; the following Sunday, 75,000 people, forming a line that was a quarter mile long, thronged the zoo to see them. In return, the U.S. sent China a pair of musk oxen named Milton and Mathilda.

Milton and Mathilda didn't fare quite as well initially: Time Magazine reported at the time that they suffered from ""culture shock"" that caused nasal drips and hair loss. (They recovered.)

Ling-Ling died in 1992 from heart failure at age 23; Hsing-Hsing, suffering from kidney disease and other health issues, was euthanized in 1999 at the age of 28.

Panda problems and limitations
In 1984, China began allowing its pandas to be hosted abroad in 10-year loan periods and required an annual fee ($1 million US dollars). Any cubs born overseas would remain Chinese property. The U.S. in 1988 said it would pay the fee only if half of the proceeds went to conservation efforts.

A 2008 earthquake in Sichuan province destroyed much of the pandas' natural habitat and China's largest conservation center. China began sending pandas overseas for breeding and research; its loans also tended to be tied to trade deals, especially with European countries, according to History.com.

Goodbye, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian; hello, Bao Li and Qing Bao
For 23 years, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian delighted visitors at the National Zoo. The two arrived in 2000, as reported by Smithsonian Magazine, and in August 2020 the pair had a cub, Xiao Qi Ji.

The little panda family returned to China in 2023, and there were concerns that rising tensions between the U.S. and China might spell the end of the two countries' panda diplomacy.

A few months later, though, the National Zoo announced pandas would return. On Friday, the public got to see them once again.

In May, when the pandas' return to the National Zoo was announced, Barbara Bodine, director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University who had more than 30 years’ experience in US foreign service, called pandas ""probably the most successful soft diplomacy animals any nation has ever come up with.""",panda-diplomacy,usa-today.txt
A brief history of 'panda diplomacy' - with new additions to global zoos,Mia Taylor,https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20240226-a-brief-history-of-panda-diplomacy---with-new-additions-to-global-zoos,8 August 2024,"With the latest panda additions to the San Diego Zoo, 'panda diplomacy' is back in the vernacular. Here's what it means and why it's so important.

After a month and a half of settling into their new home at San Diego Zoo, two giant pandas – Yun Chuan and Xin Bao – are receiving their first visits from the public.

Their arrival in the United States at the end of June 2024 marked the latest twist in China's use of its charismatic, bamboo-munching black-and-white bears as part of its international relations.

This ""panda diplomacy"" has a long history, that dates perhaps as far as the Tang Dynasty, which ruled from 618 through 907 CE. The movement of the animals around the world offers some insights into the ebb and flow of China's relationships with other nations.

The arrival of Yun Chuan and Zin Bao follows the recent recall of three giant pandas that had been living at the National Zoo in Washington DC and one living at the Memphis Zoo in Tennessee. Until June 2024, it left only four pandas in the US, all at the zoo in Atlanta, Georgia. Similarly, in the UK, two giant pandas that had lived at Edinburgh Zoo since 2011 were recalled in 2023.

Those decisions arrived at a time when relations between Beijing and the West reached a particularly rocky phase. China and the US, for example, were navigating some decidedly tense security, humanitarian and economic challenges, according to an article about animal diplomacy from Georgetown University's Barbara Bodine, a distinguished professor of diplomacy and director of Georgetown's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.

Following the agreement to send the pandas to San Diego Zoo, Chinese Premier Li Qiang also offered to send pandas to Australia as the two countries restored relations following a diplomatic dispute over agricultural and mineral exports.

The renewed flurry of panda diplomacy may be part of China’s pursuit of ""soft power"", explains Susan Brownell, a professor of anthropology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and a member of the National Committee on US-China Relations, which works to promote understanding and cooperation between the two countries. Researchers at the University of Oxford have even gone so far as to chart the trajectory of China's ""soft cuddly power"" through its use of pandas in an academic paper published in 2013.

The story behind China's ""softest and sweetest elements of public diplomacy""

Since it was founded in 1949, the People's Republic of China has used giant pandas as a gesture of goodwill towards its international allies and competitors.

The animals are native to the high, bamboo-covered mountain slopes in south-central China but now only exist in the wild in six isolated valleys within protected nature reserves, where their numbers have dwindled to just 33 populations.

Chinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong sent his first ""panda ambassadors"" as gifts to the Soviet Union in 1957 when he gifted the Ping Ping and Qi Qi to the USSR to mark the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution in Russia. He also gifted pandas to other socialist allies such as North Korea, in an effort to strengthen ties.

A major diplomatic milestone was reached, however, in 1972 – just two months after US President Richard Nixon made his historic journey to China in an attempt to end more than two decades of frosty relations between the two countries – when an 18-month-old pair of pandas arrived in the US as a gift. The pair, named Hsing-Hsing and Ling Ling, remained in the US until they died. Ling Ling suffered heart failure in 1992. while Hsing-Hising lived to be 28 years old before he was put to sleep due to failing health in 1999.

But Hsing-Hsing and Ling Ling were far from the first pandas to be gifted to the US. In 1941, two pandas were sent to the US as a ""thank you"" gift from China by Chiang Kai-Shek for assisting Chinese refugees during the country's war with Japan.

It wasn't until 1972 that China gifted Japan two pandas – Kang Kang and Lan Lan – when the two countries normalised diplomatic ties. Then in 1984 the ""gifts"" changed to ""loans"" where zoos would pay substantial fees towards panda conservation projects in China. It can cost zoos up to $1m (£790,000) a year to host a pair of pandas, plus the costs of housing the animals, keeping them in fresh bamboo and in good health.

More recently, panda loan deals have coincided with lucrative trade agreements – something the Oxford University academics associated with the Chinese concept of ""guanxi"", which is the development of deep relationships and networks of influence built on trust, loyalty and reciprocity.

Australia, for example, was loaned pandas in 2009, while Canada and France received pandas in 2012. The timing appeared to coincide follow lucrative uranium deals and contracts between China and these countries, suggests Kathleen Buckingham and colleagues at the Oxford University in their paper. The loan of two pandas ­– Tian Tian and Yang Guang – to Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland was agreed during negotiations over contracts to supply salmon meat, Land Rover vehicles and energy technology to China.

This flurry of panda loans followed the devastating earthquake in 2008 in China's Sichuan Province, which badly damaged the Wolong Nature Reserve and Breeding Centre, meaning the animals living there needed to be rehomed.

But there are still examples where pandas are used as a way of repairing strains between China and its global neighbours. Following the March 2014 disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, relations between China and Malaysia became fraught. The arrival of two pandas that same year in Malaysia was seen as a peace offering.

China also seems happy to use its pandas to signal displeasure too – what it gives, it can take away. In 2010, two US-born panda cubs were on an aircraft back to China two days after Chinese officials warned President Barack Obama ahead of a planned meeting between Obama and the Dalia Lama that they could take ""corresponding action"". The pandas were due to be returned to China two years earlier but stayed in the US due to their popularity with visitors.

The arrival of San Diego's new pandas – Yun Chuan and Xin Bao – makes them the first of the Chinese bears to enter the US in 21 years. They are expected to be followed by another pair of two-year-old pandas – Bao Li and Qing Bao – who are to be housed at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington DC, around a year after the zoo returned three of its pandas to China. The loan agreement formed part of a 10-year research and breeding cooperation agreement.

As for what the pandas may be promising today, Brownell suggests China is hoping to broaden its influence around the world. ""They know very well that their growing economic and military strength is viewed as a threat, particularly by the political leadership of the US,"" says Brownell. ""They also understand that a big factor [of US] influence in the world comes from the appeal of its cultural products, whether it's Hollywood movies or NBA stars.

""Their use of the lovable pandas, as well as the state promotion of Olympic sports, is part of their effort to develop that kind of appeal and influence in the world.""

I immediately found out it is about forming relationships – Greg Vicino

San Diego's new pandas

San Diego Zoo's newest residents will be in the US for 10 years under the loan agreement, which will help to support conservation breeding efforts in China. The male – Yun Chuan – is the son of Zhen Zhen, a cub born at San Diego Zoo in 2007 before being returned to China in 2010, and is due to turn five years old later this year. The new female panda at San Diego Zoo, whose name Xin Bao means ""previous treasure of prosperity and abundance"", is due to turn four years old.

Since arriving in the US in June, the pair have spent their first weeks away from public view, settling into their new enclosure, which features trees for climbing and rolling ""hillsides"" inspired by the mountains and canyons of China's native panda habitats. Veterinary experts from the US and China have been tracking the pandas' health after their long flight to San Diego, regularly measuring their weight, appetite and blood samples. They have also been having regular ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans in an effort to pick up on any health problems early.

Visitors to the zoo were able to get their first look at the two pandas on 8 August when they made their public debut.

San Diego Zoo was previously home to giant pandas from 1996 until their departure in 2019 and during that time a total of six pandas were born. Bai Yun and Shi Shi gave birth to the first panda cub to survive in captivity in the US, and later Bi Yung and Gao Gao gave birth to five more cubs. There was also a substantial body of research published as a result of the breeding programme.

""There was a steady flow back and forth [between San Diego and China] of researchers, scientists and graduate students coming here and going there,"" according to Greg Vicino, vice president of wildlife care at the San Diego Zoo. ""That collaboration – when you look at the list of publications that came out of that – is overwhelming. It was a big win for conservation.""

And ultimately, says Vicino, conservation boils down to relationships. ""I can tell you from my own experience, having worked in this field for over 20 years now, that I naively thought conservation was about saving habitats and saving species. But I immediately found out it is about forming relationships."" Joking that diplomacy is something he'll ""leave to the pros"", Vicino adds: ""This is really about one-on-one contact between true conservationists from different countries.""

The debut of new pandas in D.C. marks the latest chapter in China's 'panda diplomacy',Rachel Treisman,https://www.npr.org/2025/01/24/nx-s1-5272416/panda-diplomacy-china-dc-zoo,"January 24, 2025","What's black, white and back in the nation's capital? Giant pandas, at last.

Bao Li and Qing Bao, both three years old, are making their public debut at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park (aka the National Zoo) on Friday after months of anticipation and fanfare — including panda-themed pop-up bars, hotel packages and special-edition transit cards. 

The pair arrived in D.C. — aboard the fittingly nicknamed ""Panda Express"" — from China back in October. Since then, they could only be glimpsed occasionally on the zoo's social media feed (including rolling around in the flurries during a snowstorm earlier this month).

Now, after a requisite quarantine and brief preview period for zoo members, the panda exhibit and its accompanying Giant Panda Cam are back on full display. 

""Bao Li and Qing Bao have already won the hearts of our staff and volunteers, and we are excited to welcome panda fans back to the Zoo — the only place in the nation where you can see giant pandas for free — and celebrate the newest chapter of our giant panda breeding and conservation program,"" said Brandie Smith, director of the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.

Scientists estimate there are fewer than 2,000 giant pandas living in the wild, scattered throughout half a dozen mountainous regions in China. About 420 pandas live in captivity in zoos and reserves, mostly but not exclusively in China. 

That's because, over the last half a century, China has either gifted or loaned its beloved bears to zoos around the world, a practice that's become known as ""panda diplomacy."" In exchange, zoos pay a hefty fee to support panda conservation programs in China.

Under the National Zoo's agreement, Bao Li and Qing Bao will stay in D.C. until 2034, and any cubs they birth will move to China by age four. The zoo is paying $1 million annually to contribute to projects including restoring giant panda habitat, monitoring wildlife diseases and assessing the impacts of climate change.

In addition to D.C., the San Diego Zoo welcomed two pandas in 2024, while the San Francisco Zoo is anticipating the arrival of a pair this year.

Panda diplomacy is seen as a way for China to not only conserve wildlife but promote goodwill and strengthen diplomatic ties with other countries — bringing a whole new meaning to soft power.

""Many people don't realize it, but there are actually two Chinese ambassadors in Washington: me and the panda cub at the National Zoo,"" Cui Tiankai, China's then-ambassador to the U.S., wrote in a 2013 Washington Post op-ed.

Here's a look at the current state of panda diplomacy — and how we got here.

The early years: Panda-monium starts to spread

The first living giant panda exhibited in the U.S. was named Su Lin. The three-month-old cub was captured and brought over from China in 1936 by American fashion designer and socialite Ruth Harkness, who was inspired to carry out her late husband's dream.

Su Lin, who was named after Harkness' Chinese guide's sister-in-law — he was believed to be female until after his death — ended up at Chicago's Brookfield Zoo, where he became a star attraction, winning over celebrity admirers including Shirley Temple. He died of pneumonia in 1938, just weeks after Harkness brought back another panda from China — Mei Mei — to join him. Su Lin's body is still on display at Chicago's Field Museum.

Foreigners captured and took over a dozen pandas from China over the next decade, according to the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF), whose logo happens to be a panda. By the 1940s, China sought to end the exploitation of its pandas by foreigners, but recognized it had something special to offer its friends.

E. Elena Songster, a history professor at St. Mary's College of California who authored Panda Nation: The Construction and Conservation of China's Modern Icon, told WBUR in 2024 that the first time pandas were used ""as diplomatic expression"" was in 1941.

""Chiang Kai-shek's wife, Soong Mei-ling, offered a pair of pandas to the United States as an expression of gratitude for our assistance with them in their war of resistance against Japan,"" she explained.

The People's Republic of China continued that practice in the years after it took over in 1949. The U.S. initially didn't recognize and tried to weaken the communist government, forbade American citizens from visiting the country and encouraged its allies not to have diplomatic relations with China.

China began gifting pandas to its allies, including the Soviet Union and North Korea. It sent its first panda ambassadors, Ping Ping and Qi Qi, to the Soviet Union in 1957 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, writes Yu Tao, a professor of Chinese Studies at the University of Western Australia.

Between 1957 and 1983, the country sent 24 pandas to foreign countries, including the U.S. 

Mid-20th century: Panda diplomacy reaches the U.S.

The U.S. and China began to warm to each other throughout the 1970s, with President Richard Nixon's landmark 1972 visit signaling the beginning of a policy of engagement.

A pivotal moment came when China gave its first pair of pandas to the U.S., just months after Nixon's trip.

At a dinner in Beijing, while seated next to Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, First Lady Patricia Nixon commented on a box of cigarettes decorated with pandas: ""Aren't they cute? I love them.""

""I'll give you some,"" he replied, according to the Richard Nixon Foundation.

Zhou gifted two giant pandas to the U.S., and the Nixons chose the National Zoo as their home.

Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing arrived in April 1972 and lived at the zoo for the next two decades. They drew millions of visitors until their deaths in 1992 and 1999, and set a new tradition in motion.

""[The gift] made a huge splash because the U.S. was a former enemy state, and so it was a giant gesture of diplomatic friendship,"" Songster explains. ""And from that moment, [China] saw how warmly welcomed the pandas were and how popular they were and how useful they were for putting a friendly face on China.""

By 1979, the U.S. and China had established full diplomatic relations.

As other countries — including West Germany and Japan — recognized Beijing in the early 1970s, they received pandas of their own. Soon, however, the practice began to look unsustainable. 

Turn of the millennium: Gifts turn into loans

In the mid-1980s, China stopped giving pandas as gifts over concerns about its ability to maintain the wild population.

""And also at that time, there was a panda starvation scare, because there was a huge bamboo die-off in the pandas' range,"" Songster explained. ""And so from that point forward, they started loaning them.""

That shift also embodied ""China's market-orientated economic reforms,"" Tao wrote, with bears bringing in some $500,000 to $1 million per year.

While loan periods were initially relatively short, by the 1990s they had grown to at least 10 years, Songster said, proving less stressful for the animals and more conducive to reproduction.

In 1998, the U.S. shifted its acceptance policy to only allow a panda to reside stateside if China devoted more than half of its annual fee to conservation efforts, according to the History Channel. 

Today: What pandas can tell us about politics 

Scholars have noted that China's panda strategy has evolved over the decades from strategic gift-giving to a financial transaction to, as of recent years, a symbol of trade relationships.

Indeed, many of China's panda loans have coincided with trade deals. Shortly after the Edinburgh Zoo received two pandas in 2011, Scotland and China signed trade agreements involving salmon and renewable energy technology. The loan of two pandas to Germany in 2017 overlapped with Chinese leader Xi Jinping's visit to Berlin.

The timing of panda loans has also seemed to reflect the level of tension between China and other nations.

The arrival of two pandas to Malaysia in 2014 — to mark the 40th anniversary of its diplomatic ties with Beijing — was delayed by several months because of disagreements over Malaysia's handling of the disappearance of Flight MH370 (many of its passengers were Chinese). 

In November 2023, the National Zoo sent its three pandas — Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, who had lived there since 2000, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji — back to China, in advance of the expiration of their loan agreement and amidst rising tensions between the two countries.

There was no agreement in place at the time for a new set of pandas to head to D.C., and Atlanta was left as the only zoo in the country housing any pandas.

A week later, however, Xi signaled openness to sending more pandas to the U.S., specifically California. And in May 2024, the official announcement came down: A pair of pandas — Bao Li and Qing Bao — would arrive in the States by the end of the year. ",panda-diplomacy,npr.txt

The return of the pandas follows the departure of three pandas who were sent back to China in 2023 following an expired previous agreement and frosty U.S.-China relations.

The two new pandas, Bao Li and Qing Bao, will live in the National Zoo as part of a 10-year agreement with China, which owns every panda in the world.

But does this return signal a shift in bilateral relations?

Last year, we asked Ambassador Barbara K. Bodine, distinguished professor in the practice of diplomacy and director of Georgetown’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, about the state of U.S.-China relations and the history of animal diplomacy after the trio left.

This year, we asked what, if anything, has changed that would warrant the return of pandas to DC — and whether we may be reading too much into the latest episode of panda diplomacy.

### Ask a Professor: Barbara Bodine on the Return of the Pandas and U.S.-China Relations

**The giant pandas are back in DC. Does this signal any meaningful shift in U.S.-China relations? Should we be reading into this?**

Panda deliveries can signal a positive shift in relations between China and another country. Studies have been published showing that panda deliveries have been timed around all sorts of deals between China and other countries, from diplomatic recognition to uranium trade agreements.

As for this delivery — we shouldn’t read much into it. Bilateral relations have been tense since well before the pandas’ last departure in October 2023. Absent a major announcement — highly unlikely in an election year — we can only infer that China continues to use pandas as a tool for cultural diplomacy.

**It seemed unlikely last year that the pandas would return. What’s changed? Did the return of the pandas come with any strings attached?**

This is probably something a little more mundane: China is, to its credit, serious about panda conservation. Though pandas are no longer endangered, they are still classified as “vulnerable” by the World Wildlife Fund (largely thanks to Chinese efforts). Conservation of large animals is expensive. On top of upkeep costs, the Smithsonian Zoo pays $1 million a year to the China Wildlife Conservation Association for housing DC’s furry friends.

Several countries, most recently Finland, have had to return pandas to China due to the high cost of their upkeep. As a well-endowed organization, the Smithsonian doesn’t face quite the same constraints as smaller zoos in smaller countries. As a reliable partner in conservation, we have just made a major commitment by taking in these pandas.

**What are you monitoring in the coming months that could affect U.S.-China relations?**

It’s October in an election year, which sucks up all the media oxygen. Trump wants to double and triple down on his tariff policies this time around. Harris is also hawkish on China, though she would likely continue the Biden policy of light-touch tariffs alongside heavy import and export controls on high-value and military-related technologies — think semiconductors and their components.

Chinese leaders will be watching the election unfold just as closely as the rest of the world.

**What was your personal reaction to this news of a return?**

I cannot help but note the power of cultural diplomacy and admire China’s dedication to pandas as a symbol. The Washington Post is awash with pictures of happy children dressed in costumes, no doubt begging their parents for a trip to the zoo; shops and businesses around the zoo have stocked up on panda-related merchandise; and the animal-crazy corners of the internet are jubilant. Cultural diplomacy is a good thing, but it is still government policy with an agenda behind it.",panda-diplomacy,georgetown.txt
Russia's war in Ukraine: How it came to this,Tucker Reals,https://www.cbsnews.com/news/ukraine-news-russia-war-how-we-got-here/,"March 23, 2022","Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he's ready to compromise NATO ambitions to end Putin's war After Russia spent weeks building up a huge military force along its border with Ukraine and in neighboring Belarus, Russian leader Vladimir Putin launched what Ukrainian officials described as a ""full-scale invasion"" of the country on February 24, 2022. It marked the start of a grim new chapter in, and a major expansion of an eight-year war in the country's east that had already claimed thousands of lives.

""Peace on our continent has been shattered,"" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the morning after the invasion began. ""We now have war in Europe on a scale and of a type we thought belonged to history.""

Here's what you need to know about the events and the thinking that led to the war.

A brief summary of a long history In the late 1700s, much of Ukraine's territory became part of the Russian empire under Catherine the Great. Ukraine fought for independence in the early 20th century but lost and became part of the Soviet Union. 

""But it was a separate entity from the beginning,"" historian Anne Applebaum explained on CBS ""Sunday Morning"". ""It always had its own language. It always had its own status inside the USSR.""

Under Stalin's grip in the 1930s, Ukrainians' farmland and wheat were confiscated and a resulting famine killed an estimated 4 million people.

Ukraine declared its independence after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. At the time, a substantial portion of the Soviet nuclear arsenal was housed within Ukraine's borders, and it agreed to transfer those weapons to Russia.

In recent years, Ukraine's democratically elected government has grown closer to Western Europe, but cultural ties with Russia, especially in the Russian-speaking eastern portion of the country, remain deep.

Russia has invaded Ukraine before Russian forces last invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014. As he has this time, Putin claimed the assault was merely a defense of ethnic Russians who live in the eastern Donbas region, many of whom have never supported the country's relatively new pro-Western government.

But Putin used the invasion to claim part of Ukraine for Russia, unilaterally annexing the Crimean Peninsula. The annexation is not recognized by the international community, but Russia has indisputably controlled the territory since 2014.

Since 2014, a proxy war had simmered in Donbas between the Russian-backed separatist forces and the Ukrainian government. A 2015 peace deal largely ended major battles but the fighting continued, leaving more than 14,000 people dead in the process, according to the Ukrainian government.

Three days before his latest invasion, Putin unilaterally recognized the independence of two breakaway regions in Donbas — the self-declared ""People's Republics"" of Donetsk and Luhansk. The move led to the U.S. and its allies imposing new sanctions on Russia.

Now, as Ukraine's ambassador to the U.N. told CBS News correspondent Pamela Falk, Putin's ambition to ""restore the Russian Empire"" has moved beyond the annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, which his forces seized in 2014.

What does Putin want? Russia's strongman leader speaks often of the ethnic ties between Russia and Ukraine and warns against NATO expanding further eastward toward his borders.

Retired General H.R. McMaster, a former national security adviser, said on ""CBS Mornings"" following the invasion that Putin was trying to ""restore Russia to national greatness.""

""This goes back to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 — what Putin saw as a disaster and what Putin has been driven by since that time and since he took over in the year 2000, you know, 22 years ago,"" McMaster said. ""He's been driven by an obsession with restoring Russia to national greatness. And his plan to do that is not to make Russia great, it's really to drag everybody else down, and you're seeing, you know, this sustained campaign against, you know, any of the former territories of the Soviet Union and the former Warsaw Pact countries, really, designed to restore Russian influence.""

Weeks before the invasion, Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former senior intelligence analyst, told CBS News national security contributor Michael Morell she thought there were also ""legacy issues at play"" for Putin.

""Putin is thinking long term,"" she said. ""I think he believes that he is the last Russian leader who would be willing to take such risks to reassert Russia's role as a great power. And so I think for him, the time is, his clock is ticking... He sees the West as being in decline. He sees the United States is distracted. He sees the trans-Atlantic relationship as under strain and he is leaning in now, I think, to accomplish these very maximalist objectives because I think that he views this as the opportune moment to do that.""

As CBS News' David Martin reported in January, Putin's objective is to keep Ukraine — the second-largest country on the continent — from making common cause with the democracies of Europe.

""What motivates Putin,"" former NATO Ambassador Ivo Daalder told CBS News, ""is a concern about the independence of Ukraine — a worry that a functioning, successful, prosperous democracy in Ukraine poses a direct threat to his rule, because it will give people in Russia the idea that they, too, could enjoy what Ukraine enjoys, and rise up against his autocratic rule.""

Before Russia launched the current invasion, Putin demanded that NATO rule out admitting any new members from among the former Soviet states — most importantly, Ukraine — and that NATO forces pull back from positions in other countries near Russia. The U.S. and NATO flatly rejected the demand to preclude any new members.

Many analysts believe Putin's objective is topple Ukraine's current government so it can be replaced with a new pro-Russian regime.

Is Ukraine a NATO member? No. Ukraine has made the quest for NATO membership a cornerstone of its national security policy, and it refused to back down from that ambition even as Russia's invasion became more brutal. Even before the current conflict there was no discussion of Ukraine being admitted to the alliance anytime soon.

While many Ukrainians, especially in the country's east, are pro-Russian, Ukrainians ousted their last pro-Russia president in 2014 and have consistently elected pro-Western politicians since.

""The Ukrainians want to be in NATO,"" Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told CBS News' Pamela Falk in early February. ""Before 2014, they were already very pro-European Union... At that moment and before 2014, there was no majority. If you polled the nation, we wouldn't have more than 50% of Ukrainians in favor of the NATO membership. Now, we have very high figures of Ukrainians if they ask if they want to be in NATO. Because now they realize that trying to defend ourselves on our own is not only questionable from the military point of view, but it is also exceptionally expensive economically and financially.""

But by late February, amid direct negotiations between his government and Russia, President Volodymr Zelenskyy indicated for the first time that Ukraine was willing to consider adopting a neutral status as a nation.

By early March there were hints that the talks could be making some headway, and Zelenskyy told a group of European allies that his country had to accept the door to NATO membership was ""closed.""

Why is it America's problem? As Ukraine is not a NATO member, the U.S. and most of its European allies have ruled out sending troops into the country to help defend its territory. Instead, they have provided military hardware, cash, and diplomatic support.

The U.S. interest in rebuffing Russia's aggression is difficult to explain in terms of goods or American lives: Ukraine is not a significant trading partner, and a threat to its territory or sovereignty poses no direct threat to that of the United States.

But the world's most powerful democracies have struggled for years to keep Putin's myriad nefarious actions in check — from claiming Crimea, to poisoning dissidents on British soil and helping the Assad regime wage a brutal war its own people in Syria.

As Putin seeks now to deepen Russia's ties with China, another powerful nation eager to portray the Western model of democracy as past its prime, the U.S. has a clear interest in turning back his latest and boldest effort to drive a wedge between NATO members.

Russian Invasion of Ukraine,Wikipedia contributors,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine#External_links,,"This article is about the conflict that began in 2022. For other invasions that took place on the territory of Ukraine, see List of invasions and occupations of Ukraine. “War in Ukraine” redirects here. For other wars, see List of wars involving Ukraine.

On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, starting the largest and deadliest war in Europe since World War II, in a major escalation of the conflict between the two countries which began in 2014.\[15]\[16]\[17] The fighting has caused hundreds of thousands of military casualties and tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties. As of 2025, Russian troops occupy about 20 % of Ukraine. From a population of 41 million, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced and more than 8.2 million had fled the country by April 2023, creating Europe’s largest refugee crisis since World War II.

In late 2021, Russia massed troops near Ukraine’s borders and issued demands to the West including a ban on Ukraine ever joining the NATO military alliance.\[18] After repeatedly denying having plans to attack Ukraine, on 24 February 2022, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced a “special military operation”, saying that it was to support the Russian-backed breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose paramilitary forces had been fighting Ukraine in the war in Donbas since 2014. Putin espoused irredentist and imperialist views challenging Ukraine’s legitimacy as a state, baselessly claimed that the Ukrainian government were neo-Nazis committing genocide against the Russian minority in the Donbas, and said that Russia’s goal was to “demilitarise and denazify” Ukraine.\[19]\[20]\[21]\[22] Russian air strikes and a ground invasion were launched on a northern front from Belarus towards the capital Kyiv, a southern front from Crimea, and an eastern front from the Donbas and towards Kharkiv. Ukraine enacted martial law, ordered a general mobilisation, and severed diplomatic relations with Russia.

Russian troops retreated from the north and the outskirts of Kyiv by April 2022, after encountering stiff resistance and logistical challenges. The Bucha massacre was uncovered after their withdrawal. In the southeast, Russia launched an offensive in the Donbas and captured Mariupol after a destructive siege. Russia continued to bomb military and civilian targets far from the front, and struck the energy grid during winter months. In late 2022, Ukraine launched successful counteroffensives in the south and east, liberating most of Kharkiv Oblast. Soon after, Russia illegally annexed four partly-occupied provinces. In November, Ukraine liberated Kherson. In June 2023, Ukraine launched another counteroffensive in the southeast but made few gains. After small but steady Russian advances in the east in the first half of 2024, Ukraine launched a cross-border offensive into Russia’s Kursk Oblast in August, where North Korean soldiers were sent to assist Russia. The United Nations Human Rights Office reports that Russia is committing severe human rights violations in occupied Ukraine. The direct cost of the war for Russia has been over US \$450 billion.\[23]\[24]\[25]

The invasion was met with widespread international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to halt military operations, and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus and provided large-scale humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The Baltic states and Poland declared Russia a terrorist state. Protests occurred around the world, with anti-war protesters in Russia being met by mass arrests and greater media censorship. The Russian attacks on civilians have led to allegations of genocide.\[26]\[27]\[28]\[29] War-related disruption to Ukrainian agriculture and shipping contributed to a world food crisis; war-related local environmental damage has been described as ecocide and the war has heavily disrupted global climate policy. The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into crimes against humanity, war crimes, abduction of Ukrainian children, and genocide against Ukrainians. The ICC issued arrest warrants for Putin and five other Russian officials.

**Background**

*Further information: Russia–Ukraine relations*

**Post-Soviet relations**

After the dissolution of the Soviet Union in 1991, Russia and Ukraine maintained cordial relations. In return for security guarantees, Ukraine signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty in 1994 and gave up the nuclear weapons it inherited from the Soviet Union.\[30] Russia, the US, and UK thus agreed in the Budapest Memorandum to uphold Ukraine’s sovereignty and territorial integrity.\[31] In 1999, Russia signed the Charter for European Security, affirming the right of each state “to choose or change its security arrangements” and to join alliances.\[32] In 2002, Putin said Ukraine’s relations with NATO were “a matter for those two partners”.\[33] In 2005, Putin said that if Ukraine wanted to join NATO, “we will respect their choice, because it is their sovereign right to decide their own defence policy, and this will not worsen relations between our countries”.\[34]

Russia invaded Georgia in 2008 and took control of Abkhazia and South Ossetia, demonstrating Russia’s willingness to use force to attain its political objectives.\[35] The US “was accused of appeasement and naivete” over its reaction to the invasion.\[36]

**Ukrainian revolution**

*Main article: Revolution of Dignity*

Protesters at a rally on Independence Square, 19 January 2014

In 2013, Ukraine’s parliament approved finalising the European Union–Ukraine Association Agreement.\[37] Russia raised concerns about the agreement when it became clear Ukraine would no longer be able to maintain the same level of relations with Russia.\[38] Russia put pressure on Ukraine to reject the agreement and imposed economic sanctions on the country.\[39] Kremlin adviser Sergei Glazyev warned in September 2013 that if Ukraine signed the EU agreement, Russia would no longer acknowledge Ukraine’s borders.\[40]

In November, Ukrainian president Viktor Yanukovych suddenly withdrew from signing the agreement,\[41] choosing closer ties to the Russian-led Eurasian Economic Union instead. This coerced withdrawal triggered protests known as Euromaidan, culminating in the Revolution of Dignity in February 2014. Almost 100 protesters were killed by state forces. Despite signing an agreement, Yanukovych fled. Parliament voted to remove him.

**Russian invasion in Crimea and Donbas**

Ukraine, with the annexed Crimea in the south and two Russia-backed separatist republics in Donbas in the east up to the 2022 invasion

On 27 February 2014, Russian soldiers with no insignia began to invade the Ukrainian territory of Crimea,\[42] and fully controlled the peninsula by late March.\[43] At first, Russia denied the soldiers were theirs, but Putin later admitted they were Russian special forces.\[44] Russia annexed Crimea in March, after a widely condemned and disputed referendum held under occupation. Historians liken the annexation to Nazi Germany’s Anschluss of Austria.\[45]\[46]

Pro-Russian protests followed in the Ukrainian cities of Donetsk and Luhansk. Separatists proclaimed the Donetsk People’s Republic (DPR) and Luhansk People’s Republic (LPR). The War in Donbas began in April 2014 when armed Russian paramilitaries led by Igor ‘Strelkov’ Girkin seized Sloviansk and other settlements, and the Ukrainian military began an operation against them.\[47]\[48]\[49] Russia covertly supported the separatists with troops, tanks and artillery.\[50] The International Criminal Court judged that the war was a national and international armed conflict involving Russia,\[51] and the European Court of Human Rights judged that Russia controlled the DPR and LPR from 2014 onward.\[52] Ukraine’s parliament declared the Donbas region to be occupied by Russia.\[53]

The annexation of Crimea and Donbas war sparked a wave of Russian nationalism. Analyst Vladimir Socor called Putin’s 2014 speech following the annexation a “manifesto of Greater-Russia irredentism”.\[54] Putin began referring to “Novorossiya” (New Russia), a former Russian imperial territory that covered much of southern Ukraine.\[55] Russian-backed forces were influenced by Russian neo-imperialism\[56] and sought to create a new Novorossiya.\[57] Putin cited the Kosovo independence precedent and NATO bombing of Yugoslavia as a justification for military intervention.\[58]\[59]\[60]\[61]

The Normandy Format meeting in December 2019 would be the first and only meeting between Zelenskyy and Putin.\[62]

When the conflict began in 2014, Ukraine was officially a neutral country\[63] and said it was not seeking NATO membership.\[64]\[65] Because of Russia’s occupation of Crimea and its invasion of the Donbas, Ukraine’s parliament voted in December 2014 to revoke the country’s neutral status and seek membership of NATO.\[66]\[67]

The Minsk agreements, signed in September 2014 and February 2015, aimed to resolve the conflict, but ceasefires and further negotiations failed.\[68] The West’s weak response to Russia’s attack led Russia to believe the West would not react strongly to the 2022 invasion.\[69]\[70]\[71] Several political scientists said this encouraged further Russian aggression.\[72]\[73]\[74]

**Economic aspects**

Economic interests were also a motive for Russia’s attack on Ukraine and its annexation of the southeast. Control of lithium deposits in the Donbas and Ukraine’s grain wealth would give Russia a “monopoly on the world market”.\[75] In 2022, Russian General Vladimir Ovchinsky confirmed that the “Russian special operation” aimed to seize Ukrainian lithium deposits.\[23]\[76]

The US government estimates that Russia’s economic losses from the war and Western sanctions will amount to around US \$1.3 trillion by 2025, and Russia’s direct financial spending on the invasion is estimated at US \$250 billion (as of late 2024) – costs that Russia could not have foreseen. According to a study published in mid-2022 by Canadian think tank SecDev, Russia seized energy reserves, metals and minerals worth at least US \$12.4 trillion in the Donbas, including 41 coal fields (63 percent of Ukraine’s coal reserves), 27 natural gas fields, 9 oil fields, 6 iron ore deposits, two titanium ore deposits, a strontium deposit, a uranium deposit, a gold deposit and a large limestone quarry. The total value of raw material stocks in Ukraine is estimated at over US \$26 trillion.\[23] The value of lithium and rare earths in Ukraine is estimated at US \$11.5 trillion.\[76] In January 2024, the Russian occupation government in Donetsk Oblast granted the Russian Ministry of Natural Resources permission to mine lithium in the Shevchenko deposit near Kurakhovo, which is estimated to be worth hundreds of billions of US dollars.\[23]

The Russian elite, especially Russian generals, had invested assets and property in Ukraine for money laundering purposes before the invasion.\[75]

**Prelude**

*Main articles: Prelude to the Russian invasion of Ukraine, Ukraine–NATO relations § Russian opposition to Ukrainian NATO membership, and Disinformation in the Russian invasion of Ukraine*

Russian military build-up around Ukraine as of 3 December 2021

There was Russian military build-up near Ukraine’s borders in March and April 2021,\[77] and again in both Russia and Belarus from October 2021 onward.\[78] Russia said it was only holding military exercises. Members of its government, including Putin, repeatedly denied having plans to invade Ukraine, issuing denials up until the day before the invasion.\[79]\[80]\[81]

While Russian troops massed on Ukraine’s borders, Russia’s proxy forces launched thousands of attacks on Ukrainian troops in the Donbas.\[82] Observers from the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), which includes Ukraine and Russia, reported more than 90,000 ceasefire violations throughout 2021; most in Russian-controlled territory.\[83]

In July 2021, Putin published an essay “On the Historical Unity of Russians and Ukrainians”, in which he called Ukraine “historically Russian lands” and claimed there is “no historical basis” for the “idea of Ukrainian people as a nation separate from the Russians”.\[84]\[85] Putin claimed Ukraine never had “real statehood” and the creation of modern Ukraine was a mistake.\[86] Putin was accused of promoting Russian imperialism,\[87] historical revisionism and disinformation.\[88]\[89]

Meeting of the NATO-Russia Council on 12 January 2022

The December 2021 Russian ultimatum to NATO included demands that NATO end activity in its Eastern European member states and ban Ukraine or any former Soviet state from ever joining the alliance.\[18]\[90]\[91] Russia’s government said NATO was a threat and warned of a military response if it followed an “aggressive line”.\[92] Some demands had already been ruled out by NATO. A US official said the US was willing to discuss the proposals, but there were some “the Russians know are unacceptable”.\[90] Eastern European states willingly joined NATO for security reasons, and the last time a country bordering Russia had joined was in 2004. Ukraine had not yet applied, and some members were wary of letting it join.\[93] Barring Ukraine would go against NATO’s “open door” policy, and against treaties agreed to by Russia.\[94] NATO Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg replied that “Russia has no say” on whether Ukraine joins, and “no right to establish a sphere of influence to try to control their neighbours”.\[95] NATO underlined that it is a defensive alliance, and it had co-operated with Russia until the latter annexed Crimea.\[94] It offered to improve communication with Russia, and negotiate limits on missile placements and military exercises, as long as Russia withdrew troops from Ukraine’s borders,\[96] but Russia did not.

Western leaders vowed heavy sanctions would be imposed should Putin invade rather than negotiate.\[97] French President Emmanuel Macron\[98] and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz met Putin in February 2022 to dissuade him from an invasion. Putin told him that Ukraine should not be an independent state.\[99] Scholz told Ukrainian President Zelenskyy to declare Ukraine a neutral country and renounce its aspirations to join NATO. Zelenskyy replied that Putin could not be trusted, as he had broken agreements.\[100] Ukraine had been a neutral country in 2014 when Russia occupied Crimea and invaded the Donbas.\[63]\[101] On 19 February, Zelenskyy made a speech at the Munich Security Conference, calling for Western powers to end their “appeasement” towards Putin and give a clear time-frame for when Ukraine could join NATO.\[102] Analysts Taras Kuzio and Vladimir Socor agree that “when Russia made its decision to invade Ukraine, that country was more remote than ever not only from NATO membership but from any track that might lead to membership”.\[91]

Luhansk power station after being shelled by Russian-backed forces in the Donbas, 22 February 2022

Shortly before the invasion, Russia’s proxy forces stepped up attacks on Ukrainian forces and civilians in the Donbas.\[103]\[104] Separatist leaders warned that Ukraine was about to launch an offensive, but they gave no evidence, and The Guardian noted it would be “exceedingly risky” for Ukraine to assault the Donbas while Russian troops were massed on its borders.\[104] Ukraine and Western leaders accused Russia of staging false flag attacks and trying to provoke retaliation, to give Russia a pretext for invading.\[103]\[104] On 17 February, Russian proxy forces shelled a kindergarten in Ukrainian-held territory, then blamed it on Ukraine.\[104] Zelenskyy said his military would not respond to the provocations.\[103]

**Invasion plans**

The Royal United Services Institute reported that Russia’s plan involved defeating Ukraine within ten days and capturing or killing its government, followed by “mopping up” operations; establishing filtration camps for Ukrainians; setting up occupation regimes; executing people involved in the Revolution of Dignity; and lastly annexation.\[105]\[106]\[107] The decision to invade was reportedly made by Putin and a small group of war hawks or siloviki in Putin’s inner circle, including national security adviser Nikolai Patrushev and defence minister Sergei Shoigu.\[108]

**Putin’s invasion announcement**

*Main article: On conducting a special military operation*

Putin’s address to the nation on 24 February 2022. Minutes after Putin’s announcement, the invasion began.

On 21 February, Putin announced that Russia recognised the Donetsk People’s Republic and Luhansk People’s Republic as independent states. The following day, Russia announced that it was sending troops into the territories as “peacekeepers”,\[109] and the Federation Council of Russia authorised the use of military force abroad.\[110]

Before 5 a.m. Kyiv time on 24 February, Putin, in another speech, announced a “special military operation”, which effectively declared war on Ukraine.\[111]\[112] Putin said the operation was to “protect the people” of the Russian-controlled breakaway republics. He baselessly claimed that Russians in the Donbas had “been facing humiliation and genocide perpetrated by the Kyiv regime” for 8 years.\[20] Putin said Russia was being threatened: he baselessly claimed that Ukrainian officials were neo-Nazis under Western control, that Ukraine was developing nuclear weapons, and a hostile NATO was building up its forces and infrastructure in Ukraine.\[113]\[114] He said Russia sought the “demilitarisation and denazification” of Ukraine, and denied the legitimacy of the Ukrainian state.\[114]\[86] Putin said he had no plans to occupy Ukraine.\[113] The invasion began within minutes of Putin’s speech.\[111]

**Events**

For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine.
For a more comprehensive list, see List of military engagements during the Russian invasion of Ukraine.

Ukrainian regions annexed by Russia since 2014 (Autonomous Republic of Crimea and Sevastopol) and 2022 (others). The 2022 annexation created a strategic land bridge between Crimea and Russia.

The invasion began at dawn on 24 February.\[111]\[115] It was the biggest attack on a European country and first full-scale war in Europe since World War II.\[116] Russia launched a simultaneous ground and air attack.\[117]\[118] Missiles struck targets throughout Ukraine,\[119] and Russian troops invaded from the north, east, and south.\[120] Russia did not officially declare war.\[121] Immediately after the invasion began, Zelenskyy declared martial law in Ukraine in a video speech.\[122] The same evening, he ordered a general mobilisation of all Ukrainian males aged 18–60,\[123] prohibiting them from leaving the country.\[124]

*Remnants of a destroyed Russian column on 27 February in Bucha*

The first stage of the invasion was conducted on four fronts: one towards western Kyiv from Belarus by the Russian Eastern Military District, one deployed towards eastern Kyiv by the Central Military District (northeastern front), comprised the 41st Combined Arms Army and the 2nd Guards Combined Arms Army,\[125] one deployed towards Kharkiv, and a fourth, southern front originating in Crimea and Russia’s Rostov oblast with an eastern axis towards Odesa and a western area of operations toward Mariupol.\[125] The invasion was unexpectedly met by fierce resistance.\[126] In Kyiv, Russia failed to take it and was repulsed in the battles of Irpin, Hostomel, and Bucha. The Russians tried to encircle the capital, but defenders under Oleksandr Syrskyi held their ground, effectively using Western Javelin anti-tank missiles and Stinger anti-aircraft missiles to thin Russian supply lines and stall the offensive.\[127]

By 7 April, Russian troops deployed to the northern front pulled back from Kyiv, to resupply and redeploy to the Donbas to reinforce the renewed invasion of southeastern Ukraine. The northeastern front, including the Central Military District, was similarly withdrawn for redeployment to southeastern Ukraine.\[125]\[128] On 26 April, delegates from the US and 40 allied nations met at Ramstein Air Base in Germany to discuss a coalition to provide economic support, in addition to military supplies and refitting to Ukraine.\[129] Following Putin’s Victory Day speech on 9 May, US Director of National Intelligence Avril Haines said no short term resolution should be expected.\[130]

Ukraine’s reliance on Western-supplied equipment constrained operational effectiveness, as supplying countries feared Ukraine would use Western-made matériel to strike targets in Russia.\[131] Experts disagreed on the future of the conflict; some suggested Ukraine should trade territory for peace,\[132] others believed Ukraine could maintain its resistance due to Russian losses.\[133]

Russian tried to seize Kyiv quickly with a probative spearhead on 24 February, from Belarus south along the west bank of the Dnipro River, with Spetsnaz infiltrating into the city supported by airborne operations and a rapid mechanised advance from the north, but failed.\[134]\[135] The apparent intent was to encircle the city from the west, supported by two separate axes of attack along the east bank of the Dnipro: the western at Chernihiv, and from the east at Sumy.\[117]\[118] Russian forces advanced into Chernihiv Oblast on 24 February, besieging its administrative capital within four days of fighting.\[136]\[137] Travelling along highways, Russian forces reached Brovary, an eastern suburb of Kyiv, on 4 March.\[118]\[117]

The US contacted Zelenskyy and offered to help him flee, lest the Russian Army attempt to kidnap or kill him on seizing Kyiv; Zelenskyy responded that “The fight is here; I need ammunition, not a ride.”\[138] By early March, Russian advances along the west side of the Dnipro were limited by Ukrainian defences.\[118]\[117] As of 5 March, a Russian convoy, reportedly 64 kilometres (40 mi) long, had made little progress toward Kyiv.\[139] Advances from Chernihiv largely halted as a siege began there. Russian forces advanced on Kyiv from the northwest, capturing Bucha, Hostomel and Vorzel by 5 March.\[140]\[141]\[142] By 11 March, the lengthy convoy had largely dispersed and taken cover.\[143] On 16 March, Ukrainian forces began a counter-offensive.\[144] Unable to achieve a quick victory in Kyiv, Russian forces switched to indiscriminate bombing and siege warfare.\[145]\[146]

On 25 March, a Ukrainian counter-offensive retook towns to the east and west of Kyiv.\[147]\[148] Russian troops in the Bucha area retreated north. Ukrainian forces entered the city on 1 April, and recaptured the region around Kyiv, and uncovered evidence of war crimes in Bucha.\[149]\[150] The Pentagon confirmed on 6 April that the Russian army had left Chernihiv Oblast;\[151] local authorities said Russian troops had left Sumy Oblast.\[152] NATO secretary-general Jens Stoltenberg said the Russian “retraction, resupply, and redeployment” of troops from the Kyiv area should be interpreted as an expansion of Putin’s plans for concentrating his forces on eastern Ukraine.\[128]

Russian bombardment on the outskirts of Kharkiv, 1 March 2022

On 24 February, Russian attack groups moved northwest from Crimea, capturing bridges over the Dnieper\[153] and the North Crimean Canal.\[154] On 1 March, Kherson was the first major city to fall to Russia.\[155] Russian troops moved on Mykolaiv and attacked it, but were repelled.\[156] Russian forces approached the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant\[157] and besieged Enerhodar. By 25 February, Russian units had begun advancing on Mariupol.\[158] Russian forces captured Berdiansk.\[159]\[160]\[161] On 1 March, Denis Pushilin, head of the DPR, announced that it had surrounded Volnovakha.\[162]

By 18 March, Mariupol was completely encircled and fighting had reached the city centre, hampering efforts to evacuate civilians.\[163] The Russians demanded surrender, and the Ukrainians refused.\[164] On 27 March, Ukrainian deputy prime minister Olha Stefanishyna said that “(m)ore than 85 percent of the whole town is destroyed.”\[165] Russia refused safe passage into Mariupol to 50 buses sent by the UN to evacuate civilians.\[166]\[167]

In the east, Russian troops attempted to capture Kharkiv,\[168] and met strong Ukrainian resistance. Izium was captured by Russian forces on 1 April\[169] after a monthlong battle.\[170] On 25 March, the Russian defence ministry said it would seek to occupy major cities in eastern Ukraine.\[171]

On 3 April, following the retreat of Russian forces from Kyiv, Russia expanded its attack on southern Ukraine, with bombardment and strikes against Odesa, Mykolaiv, and the Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant.\[172]\[173] By 7 April, the renewed massing of Russian troops and tanks around Izium, Sloviansk, and Kramatorsk prompted Ukrainian officials to advise remaining residents near the eastern border to evacuate to western Ukraine.\[174]

**Southeastern front (8 April – 5 September 2022)**

For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (8 April – 28 August 2022).

*Animated map of the Russian invasion from 7 April to 5 September 2022*

By 17 April, Russian progress on the southeastern front appeared impeded by Ukrainian forces in the large, heavily fortified Azovstal Iron and Steel Works and surrounding area in Mariupol.\[175] On 19 April Russia launched an “eastern assault” across a 480-kilometre (300 mi) front extending from Kharkiv to Donetsk and Luhansk, with simultaneous missile attacks again directed at Kyiv and Lviv.\[176] An anonymous US Defence official called the Russian offensive “very tepid”, “minimal at best”, and “anaemic”.\[177]

By 30 May, disparities between Russian and Ukrainian artillery were apparent, with Ukrainian artillery vastly outgunned, in range and number.\[131] In response to Biden’s indication that enhanced artillery would be provided to Ukraine, Putin said Russia would expand its invasion to include new cities. In apparent retribution, Putin ordered a missile strike against Kyiv on 6 June after not directly attacking it for weeks.\[178] On 10 June, deputy head of the SBU Vadym Skibitsky stated that during the Sievierodonetsk campaign, the frontlines were where the future of the invasion would be decided:\[179]

> This is an artillery war now, and we are losing in terms of artillery. Everything now depends on what \[the west] gives us. Ukraine has one artillery piece to 10 to 15 Russian artillery pieces. Our western partners have given us about 10 % of what they have.

On 29 June, US Intelligence Director Avril Haines said US agencies agreed the invasion will continue “for an extended period of time ... In short, the picture remains pretty grim and Russia’s attitude toward the West is hardening.”\[180] On 5 July, BBC reported that extensive destruction by the invasion would cause immense financial damage to Ukraine’s economy, with Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal telling nations at a reconstruction conference that Ukraine needed US \$750 billion for a recovery plan and Russian oligarchs should contribute.\[181]

The chief spokesman for the Russian Ministry of Defence Igor Konashenkov revealed that Russian troops were divided between the Army Groups “Centre” commanded by Colonel General Aleksander Lapin and “South” commanded by Army General Sergey Surovikin.\[182] On 20 July, Lavrov announced that Russia would respond to the increased military aid being received by Ukraine from abroad as justifying the expansion of its special military operation to Zaporizhzhia and Kherson oblasts.\[183] Russian Ground Forces started recruiting volunteer battalions from the regions in June to create a new 3rd Army Corps within the Western Military District, with a planned strength of 16,000–60,000 personnel.\[184] Its units were deployed to the front around the September Kharkiv counteroffensive, in time to join the Russian retreat. The 3rd Army “melted away” according to Forbes, having little impact on the battlefield along with other irregular forces.\[185]

**Fall of Mariupol**

*Further information: Siege of Mariupol*

On 13 April, Russian forces intensified their attack on the Azovstal Iron and Steel Works.\[186] Ukrainian prime minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukrainian soldiers had vowed to ignore the ultimatum to surrender and fight to the last.\[175] On 20 April, Putin said the siege could be considered tactically complete, since the 500 Ukrainian troops entrenched in bunkers within the iron works and estimated 1,000 civilians were sealed off from relief.\[187]

After meetings with Putin and Zelenskyy, UN Secretary-General Guterres on 28 April said he would attempt to organise a evacuation from Azovstal in accordance with assurances from Putin.\[188] On 30 April, Russian troops allowed civilians to leave under UN protection.\[189] By 3 May, after allowing 100 civilians to depart the steel factory, Russian troops renewed their bombardment.\[190] On 6 May, The Daily Telegraph reported that Russia had used thermobaric bombs against the remaining soldiers. Zelenskyy authorised the commander of the steel factory to surrender as necessary.\[191] On 7 May, all civilians were evacuated.\[192]

*A children’s hospital in Mariupol after a Russian airstrike*

After the last civilians evacuated, 2,000 Ukrainian soldiers remained barricaded there, 700 were injured. They communicated a plea for a military corridor to evacuate, as they expected execution if they surrendered.\[193] Reports of dissent were reported on 8 May indicating that the commander of the Ukrainian marines had made an unauthorised acquisition of tanks, munitions, and personnel, broke out from the position and fled. The remaining soldiers spoke of a weakened defense as a result, which allowed progress to advancing Russian attacks.\[194] Ilia Somolienko, deputy commander of the remaining Ukrainian troops, said: “We are basically here dead men. Most of us know this and it’s why we fight so fearlessly.”\[195]

On 16 May, the Ukrainian General staff announced that the Mariupol garrison had “fulfilled its combat mission” and final evacuations had begun. 264 service members were evacuated to Olenivka under Russian control, while 53 who were seriously injured were taken to a hospital in Novoazovsk, controlled by Russia.\[196]\[197] Following the evacuation, Russian and DPR forces fully controlled Mariupol. The end of the battle brought an end to the Siege of Mariupol. Russia press secretary Dmitry Peskov said Putin had guaranteed that the fighters who surrendered would be treated “in accordance with international standards” while Zelenskyy said that “the work of bringing the boys home continues...”\[198]

**Fall of Sievierodonetsk and Lysychansk**

Military control around Donbas as of 11 September 2024: pink highlights areas held by the DNR, LNR, and Russia, yellow highlights areas held by the Ukrainian government.

A Russian missile attack on Kramatorsk railway station in Kramatorsk took place on 8 April, killing at least 61\[199] and injuring 87 to 300.\[200] On 11 April, Zelenskyy said Ukraine expected a new Russian offensive in the east.\[201] American officials said Russia had withdrawn or been repulsed elsewhere, and therefore was preparing a retraction, resupply, and redeployment to the southeastern Ukraine front.\[202]\[203] Military satellites photographed Russian convoys of infantry and mechanised units deploying south from Kharkiv to Izium on 11 April, apparently part of the planned Russian redeployment.\[204]

On 18 April, with Mariupol overtaken by Russian forces, the Ukrainian government announced that the second phase of the reinforced invasion of the Donetsk, Luhansk and Kharkiv oblasts had intensified with expanded invasion forces occupying of the Donbas.\[205] On 22 May, the BBC reported that after the fall of Mariupol, Russia had intensified offensives in Luhansk and Donetsk while concentrating missile attacks and intense artillery fire on Sievierodonetsk, the largest city under Ukrainian control in Luhansk Oblast.\[206] On 23 May, Russian forces were reported entering Lyman, capturing the city by 26 May.\[207]\[208] Ukrainian forces were reported leaving Sviatohirsk.\[209] By 24 May, Russian forces captured the city of Svitlodarsk.\[210] On 30 May, Reuters reported that Russian troops had breached the outskirts of Sievierodonetsk.\[211] By 2 June, The Washington Post reported that Sievierodonetsk was on the brink of capitulation to Russian occupation with over 80 % in the hands of Russian troops.\[212] On 3 June, Ukrainian forces reportedly began a counter-attack in Sievierodonetsk. By 4 June, Ukrainian government sources claimed 20 % or more of the city had been recaptured.\[213]

Ukrainian authorities estimated that 800 Ukrainian civilians were besieged at the Azot chemical factory in Sievierodonetsk; Russian-backed separatists said it sheltered 300–400 soldiers.\[214]\[215] With the Ukrainian defences of Sievierodonetsk faltering, Russian troops began intensifying their attack upon the neighbouring city of Lysychansk as their next target.\[216] On 20 June it was reported that Russian troops continued to tighten their grip on Sievierodonetsk by capturing surrounding villages.\[217]

On 24 June, CNN reported that, amid scorched-earth tactics by advancing Russian troops, Ukraine’s armed forces were ordered to evacuate Sievierodonetsk; several hundred civilians taking refuge in the Azot chemical plant were left behind, with some comparing their plight to those at the Azovstal steel works in Mariupol in May.\[218] On 3 July, the Russian defence ministry claimed Lysychansk had been captured and occupied by Russian forces.\[219] On 4 July, The Guardian reported that after the fall of the Luhansk oblast, Russian troops would continue their invasion into the adjacent Donetsk Oblast to attack the cities of Sloviansk and Bakhmut.\[220]

**Zaporizhzhia front**

French president Emmanuel Macron called the Russian missile attack on a shopping mall in Kremenchuk on 28 June 2022 a “war crime”

Russian forces continued to fire missiles and drop bombs on Dnipro and Zaporizhzhia.\[176] Russian missiles destroyed the Dnipro International Airport on 10 April.\[221] On 2 May, the UN, reportedly with the cooperation of Russian troops, evacuated about 100 survivors from the siege of Mariupol.\[222] On 28 June, Reuters reported that a Russian missile attack on Kremenchuk, detonated in a mall, had caused at least 18 deaths. France’s Macron called it a “war crime”.\[223]

The president of Ukrainian nuclear agency Energoatom called the situation at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant “extremely tense”, saying that it was being operated by Ukrainian staff but controlled by up to 500 Russian soldiers, with Russia shelling nearby areas and storing weapons at the plant.\[224] Russia agreed on 19 August to allow IAEA inspectors access to the plant after a call from Macron to Putin. As of July 2023, access to the plant remained limited and required extensive negotiation.\[225]

*Ukrainian civilians killed by the Russian Armed Forces during the Zaporizhzhia civilian convoy attack in September 2022*

Russia reported that 12 attacks with explosions from 50 artillery shells had been recorded by 18 August at the plant and the company town of Enerhodar.\[226] Tobias Ellwood, chair of the UK’s Defence Select Committee, and US congressman Adam Kinzinger said that radiation leaks would be a breach of Article 5 of the North Atlantic Treaty, under which an attack on a member of NATO is an attack on them all.\[227]\[228]

*Animated map of the Russian invasion from 5 September 2022 to 11 November 2022*

On 6 September 2022, Ukrainian forces launched a surprise counteroffensive in the Kharkiv region, beginning near Balakliia, led by General Syrskyi.\[229] An emboldened Kyiv launched a counteroffensive 12 September around Kharkiv successful enough to make Russia admit losing key positions and for The New York Times to say that it dented the image of a “Mighty Putin”. Kyiv sought more arms from the West to sustain the counteroffensive.\[230] On 21 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced a partial mobilisation and Minister of Defence Sergei Shoigu said 300,000 reservists would be called.\[231] He also said that his country would use “all means” to “defend itself”. Mykhailo Podolyak, an adviser to Zelenskyy, said that the decision was predictable and that it was an attempt to justify “Russia’s failures”.\[232] British Foreign Office Minister Gillian Keegan called the situation an “escalation”,\[233] while former Mongolian president Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj accused Russia of using Russian Mongols as “cannon fodder”.\[234]

**Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts**

*Main article: Russian annexation of Donetsk, Kherson, Luhansk and Zaporizhzhia oblasts*

In late September 2022, Russian-installed officials in Ukraine organised referendums on the annexation of the occupied territories of Ukraine. These included the Donetsk People’s Republic and the Luhansk People’s Republic in Russian-occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts of Ukraine, as well as the Russian-appointed military administrations of Kherson Oblast and Zaporizhzhia Oblast. Denounced by Ukraine’s government and its allies as sham elections, the elections’ official results showed overwhelming majorities in favour of annexation.\[235]

On 30 September 2022, Vladimir Putin announced the annexation of Ukraine’s Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia oblasts in an address to both houses of the Russian parliament.\[236] Ukraine, the United States, the European Union and the United Nations all denounced the annexation as illegal.\[237]

**Kherson counteroffensive**

*Main articles: 2022 Kherson counteroffensive and Liberation of Kherson*

On 29 August, Zelenskyy announced the start of a full-scale counteroffensive in the southeast to retake Russian-occupied territory in the Kherson and Mykolaiv regions.\[238] By 4 September, Ukrainian forces had retaken the village of Vysokopillia.\[239] Ukrainian attacks also continued along the southern frontline, though reports about territorial changes were largely unverifiable.\[240]

In October, Ukrainian forces pushed further south towards the city of Kherson, taking control of 1,170 square kilometres (450 sq mi) of territory, with fighting extending to Dudchany.\[241]\[242] On 9 November, defence minister Shoigu ordered Russian forces to leave part of Kherson Oblast, including the city of Kherson, and move to the eastern bank of the Dnieper.\[243] On 11 November, Ukrainian troops entered Kherson, as Russia completed its withdrawal. This meant that Russian forces no longer had a foothold on the west (right) bank of the Dnieper.\[244]

**Kharkiv counteroffensive**

Map of the Kharkiv front as of 7 June 2025

Ukrainian forces launched another surprise counteroffensive on 6 September in the Kharkiv Oblast near Balakliia led by General Syrskyi.\[229] By 7 September, Ukrainian forces had advanced some 20 kilometres (12 mi) into Russian occupied territory and claimed to have recaptured approximately 400 square kilometres (150 sq mi). Russian commentators said this was likely due to the relocation of Russian forces to Kherson in response to the Ukrainian offensive there.\[245] On 8 September, Ukrainian forces captured Balakliia and advanced to within 15 kilometres (9.3 mi) of Kupiansk.\[246] Military analysts said Ukrainian forces appeared to be moving towards Kupiansk, a major railway hub, with the aim of cutting off the Russian forces at Izium from the north.\[247]

On 9 September, the Russian occupation administration of Kharkiv Oblast announced it would “evacuate” the civilian populations of Izium, Kupiansk and Velykyi Burluk. The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) said it believed Kupiansk would likely fall in the next 72 hours,\[248] while Russian reserve units were sent to the area by both road and helicopter.\[249] On the morning of 10 September, photos emerged claiming to depict Ukrainian troops raising the Ukrainian flag in the centre of Kupiansk,\[250] and the ISW said Ukrainian forces had captured approximately 2,500 square kilometres (970 sq mi) by effectively exploiting their breakthrough.\[251] Later in the day, Reuters reported that Russian positions in northeast Ukraine had “collapsed” in the face of the Ukrainian assault, with Russian forces forced to withdraw from their base at Izium after being cut off by the capture of Kupiansk.\[252]

By 15 September, an assessment by UK’s Ministry of Defence confirmed that Russia had either lost or withdrawn from almost all of their positions west of the Oskil river. The retreating units had also abandoned various high-value military assets.\[253] The offensive continued pushing east and by 1 October, Ukrainian Armed Forces had liberated the key city of Lyman.\[254]

After the end of the twin Ukrainian counteroffensives, the fighting shifted to a semi-deadlock during the winter,\[255] with heavy casualties but reduced motion of the frontline.\[256] Russia launched a self-proclaimed winter offensive in eastern Ukraine, but the campaign ended in “disappointment” for Moscow, with limited gains as the offensive stalled.\[255]\[257] Analysts variously blamed the failure on Russia’s lack of “trained men”, and supply problems with artillery ammunition, among other problems.\[255]\[257] Near the end of May, Mark Galeotti assessed that “after Russia’s abortive and ill-conceived winter offensive, which squandered its opportunity to consolidate its forces, Ukraine is in a relatively strong position.”\[258]

On 7 February, The New York Times reported that Russians had newly mobilised nearly 200,000 soldiers to participate in the offensive in the Donbas, against Ukraine troops already wearied by previous fighting.\[259] The Russian private military company Wagner Group took on greater prominence in the war,\[260] leading “grinding advances” in Bakhmut with tens of thousands of recruits from prison battalions taking part in “near suicidal” assaults on Ukrainian positions.\[257]

In late January 2023, fighting intensified in southern Zaporizhzhia Oblast, with both sides suffering heavy casualties.\[261] In nearby southern parts of Donetsk Oblast, an intense, three-week Russian assault near the coal-mining town of Vuhledar was called the largest tank battle of the war to date, and ended in disaster for Russian forces, who lost “at least 130 tanks and armored personnel carriers” according to Ukrainian commanders. The British Ministry of Defence stated that “a whole Russian brigade was effectively annihilated.”\[262]\[263]

In late 2022, as Russian casualties exceeded 50,000, the Russian army introduced barrier troops. The U.K. defence ministry stated that these are units that threaten to shoot their own retreating soldiers in order to compel offensives. In March 2023, Russian soldiers filmed a video addressed to President Putin where they stated that after suffering casualties, they attempted to return to their headquarters but their superiors denied them evacuation. They stated that barrier troops were placed behind them threatening to “destroy them”.\[264] In particular, Storm-Z units have been reported to be “kept in line” by barrier troops.\[265]

**Battle of Bakhmut**

*Main article: Battle of Bakhmut*

Following defeat in Kherson and Kharkiv, Russian and Wagner forces focused on taking the city of Bakhmut and breaking the half year long stalemate that prevailed there since the start of the war. Russian forces sought to encircle the city, attacking from the north via Soledar. After taking heavy casualties, Russian and Wagner forces took control of Soledar on 16 January 2023.\[266]\[267] By early February 2023, Bakhmut was facing attacks from north, south and east, with the sole Ukrainian supply lines coming from Chasiv Yar to the west.\[268]

On 4 March, Bakhmut’s deputy mayor told news services that there was street fighting in the city.\[269] On 20 May 2023, the Wagner Group claimed full control over Bakhmut, and a victory in the battle was officially declared by Russia the next day,\[270] following which Wagner forces retreated from the city in place of regular Russian units.\[271]

In June 2023, Ukrainian forces launched counteroffensives on multiple fronts.\[272]\[273] Efforts faced stiff Russian resistance.\[274] By 12 June, Ukraine reported advances and liberated settlements.\[275] On 24 June, the Wagner Group rebellion briefly unfolded before a peace deal.\[276] In late June, Ukraine reclaimed territory in Donbas and made gains in Kherson Oblast.\[277] Russia heavily mined areas, making Ukraine the most mined country in the world.\[278] Following Russia leaving the Black Sea Grain Initiative, Ukraine targeted Russian ships.\[279] In September 2023, Russian strikes hit Ukrainian energy facilities.\[280] The US announced sending long-range ATACMS missiles\[281] and Ukraine struck the Sevastopol naval base.\[282]

In October–December 2023, Ukrainian forces crossed the Dnipro river despite heavy losses. On 1 December 2023, Zelenskyy stated that the Ukrainian counter-offensive was unsuccessful, citing slow results.\[283] Zelenskyy stated it would be easier for Ukraine to regain Crimea than the Donbas, because the latter is heavily militarised with much pro-Russian sentiment.\[284] In December 2023, media outlets described the Ukrainian counteroffensive as having failed to regain significant territory or meet any of its objectives.\[283]\[285]\[286]

**Battle of Avdiivka**

For a chronological guide, see Timeline of the Russian invasion of Ukraine (1 December 2023 – 31 March 2024).

Damaged buildings in Avdiivka during fighting over the city in January 2024

In October 2023, it was reported that there was a growth of mutinies among Russian troops due to the large number of losses in Russian offensives around Avdiivka with a lack of artillery, food, water and poor command also being reported.\[287] By November, British intelligence said that recent weeks had “likely seen some of the highest Russian casualty rates of the war so far.”\[288]

On 17 February 2024, Russia captured Avdiivka, a longtime stronghold for Ukraine that had been described as a “gateway” to nearby Donetsk.\[289]\[290]\[291] ABC News stated that Russia could use the development to boost morale with the war largely at a stalemate close to its second anniversary.\[292] Described by Forbes journalist David Axe as a pyrrhic Russian victory, the Russian 2nd and 41st Combined Arms Armies ended up with 16,000 men killed, tens of thousands wounded and around 700 vehicles lost before seizing the ruins of Avdiivka.\[293]

Ukraine’s shortage of ammunition caused by political deadlock in the US Congress and a lack of production capacity in Europe contributed to the Ukrainian withdrawal from Avdiivka, and was “being felt across the front” according to Time. The shortage resulted in Ukraine having to ration its units to fire only 2,000 rounds per day, compared to an estimated 10,000 rounds fired daily by Russia.\[294]

View of Vovchansk during the 2024 Kharkiv offensive, June 2024

On 10 May 2024, Russia began a renewed offensive in Kharkiv Oblast. Russia managed to capture a dozen villages, and Ukraine had evacuated more than 11,000 people from the region since the start of the offensive by 25 May. Ukraine said on 17 May that its forces had slowed the Russian advance, and by 25 May Zelenskyy said that Ukrainian forces had secured “combat control” of areas where Russian troops entered the northeastern Kharkiv Oblast. Russian officials said that they were “advancing in every direction” and that the goal was to create a “buffer zone” for embattled border regions.\[295]\[296] The White House said on 7 June that the offensive had stalled and was unlikely to advance further.\[297]

Following the Russian success in the battle of Avdiivka, their forces advanced northwest of it to form a salient, and by mid-April 2024 reached the settlement of Ocheretyne, capturing it in late April\[298]\[299] and further expanding the salient in the succeeding months.\[300] Russian forces also launched an offensive towards the city of Chasiv Yar in early April,\[301] a strategically important settlement west of Bakhmut, and by early July had captured its easternmost district.\[302]\[303] Another offensive in the direction of the city of Toretsk was launched on 18 June,\[304] with the goal of capturing the city,\[305] and according to Ukrainian military observer and spokesperson Nazar Voloshyn, flanking Chasiv Yar from the south.\[306] Russian forces advanced to expand the salient northwest of Avdiivka in July, and on 19 July, made a breakthrough allowing them to begin advancing towards the operationally significant city of Pokrovsk.\[307]\[308]

**Ukrainian offensive into Russia**

*Main article: Kursk offensive (2024–2025)*

On 6 August 2024, Ukraine launched their first direct offensive into Russian territory, the largest of any pro-Ukrainian incursion since the invasion’s inception, into the bordering Kursk Oblast.\[309] The main axis of the initial advance centred in the direction of the town of Sudzha, located 10 kilometres (6.2 mi) from the border,\[310] which was reported by President Zelenskyy to have been captured on 15 August.\[311] Ukraine, taking advantage of the lack of experienced units and defences along the border with Kursk Oblast, was able to quickly seize territory in the opening days of the incursion.\[312] The incursion caused Russia to divert thousands of troops from occupied Ukrainian territory to counter the threat,\[313]\[314] though not from Donetsk Oblast.\[314]

Despite repeated deadlines set by Putin to push out Ukrainian troops, Russian forces had still not yet done so by the end of January 2025, with advances in Donetsk Oblast being prioritized over the Kursk salient. However, by February 2025, Russian forces in Donetsk Oblast were described by the ISW as not being fully protected from the theater-wide impacts of the incursion, with troops, armored vehicles, artillery, and air defence systems being pulled away from Ukrainian sectors to reinforce the Russian forces in Kursk.\[315]\[316]

Russian troops continued advancing in eastern Ukraine, notably at a faster pace than prior to the Kursk offensive,\[317] including towards the strategically important city of Pokrovsk, where their number of forces had instead been increased.\[318]\[319]\[320]

In late August 2024, Russian forces seized the city of Novohrodivka, southeast of Pokrovsk, bringing them within 8 kilometres of the city,\[317] while capturing Krasnohorivka\[321] and Ukrainsk,\[322] near Pokrovsk and west of Donetsk city, in early September.\[322] In late September, a Russian assault on the long-held city of Vuhledar began,\[323] leading to its fall on 1 October. Following the Russian capture, the city with a pre-war population of about 14,000 was described as a “sprawling ruin”.\[324]\[325]

On 30 October, Ukrainian Major General Dmytro Marchenko was reported to have said “our front has crumbled” due to a dwindling ammunition supply, problems with military recruitment, and poor leadership. He said Zelensky’s victory plan was too heavily focused on seeking more Western support. Briefings from Western officials had also become more pessimistic about Ukraine’s military situation.\[326]\[327] According to the Prosecutor General’s Office, more than 100,000 criminal cases for desertion were initiated by the end of November 2024.\[328] Russian forces then captured the city of Kurakhove in late December 2024, and the nearby Kurakhove Power Station in January 2025.\[329]\[330]

In early 2025, Russian forces advanced in eastern Ukraine,\[331]\[332] capturing Velyka Novosilka and most of Toretsk by late January.\[333]\[334] Russia continued attacks on the Ukrainian energy infrastructure.\[335] In February 2025, Ukraine’s government approved a one-year contract for volunteers aged 18–24 who are currently not subject to mobilization.\[336]

**Battlespaces**

*Further information: Northern front; Eastern front; Southern front*

Frontlines of the Russian invasion of Ukraine stretch for over 600 miles. The frontlines are divided into three separate fronts, southern front, eastern front, and the northern front. Various high-profile battles took place in the fronts, with Kursk offensive in the north, Pokrovsk offensive in the east and naval warfare with Russian forces in the south near the Black Sea.\[337]

**Command**

The supreme commanders-in-chief are the heads of state of the respective governments: President Vladimir Putin of Russia and President Volodymyr Zelenskyy of Ukraine. Putin has reportedly meddled in operational decisions, bypassing senior commanders and giving orders directly to brigade commanders.\[338]

US general Mark Milley wrote in May 2022 that Ukraine’s top military commander in the war, commander-in-chief of the Armed Forces of Ukraine, General Valerii Zaluzhnyi, “has emerged as the military mind his country needed. His leadership enabled the Ukrainian armed forces to adapt quickly with battlefield initiative against the Russians.”\[339] Russia began the invasion with no overall commander. The commanders of the four military districts were each responsible for their own offensives.\[340]

After initial setbacks, the commander of the Russian Southern Military District, Aleksandr Dvornikov, was placed in overall command on 8 April 2022,\[341] while still responsible for his own campaign. Russian forces benefited from the centralisation of command under Dvornikov,\[342] but continued failures to meet expectations in Moscow led to multiple changes in overall command:\[340]

* commander of the Eastern Military District Gennady Zhidko (Eastern Military District, 26 May – 8 October 2022)
* commander of the southern grouping of forces Sergei Surovikin (early October 2022 – 11 January 2023)
* commander-in-chief of the Russian Armed Forces Valerii Gerasimov (from 11 January 2023)

Russia has suffered a remarkably large number of casualties in the ranks of its officers, including a number of generals.\[343]

**Missile attacks and aerial warfare**

Aerial warfare began the first day of the invasion. Dozens of missile attacks were recorded across both eastern and western Ukraine,\[117]\[118] reaching as far west as Lviv.\[344]

By September 2022, the Ukrainian air force had shot down about 55 Russian warplanes.\[345] In mid-October, Russian forces launched missile strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure, intended to knock out energy facilities.\[346] By late November, hundreds of civilians had been killed or wounded in the attacks,\[347] and rolling blackouts had left millions without power.\[348]

In December 2022, drones launched from Ukraine allegedly carried out several attacks on Dyagilevo and Engels air bases in western Russia, killing 10 and heavily damaging two Tu-95 aircraft.\[349]

**Crimea attacks**

*Main article: Crimea attacks (2022–present)*

On 31 July 2022, Russian Navy Day commemorations were cancelled after a drone attack reportedly wounded several people at the Russian Black Sea Fleet headquarters in Sevastopol.\[350] On 9 August 2022, large explosions were reported at Saky Air Base in western Crimea. Satellite imagery showed at least eight aircraft damaged or destroyed. Initial speculation attributed the explosions to long-range missiles, sabotage by special forces or an accident;\[351] Ukrainian general Valerii Zaluzhnyi claimed responsibility on 7 September.\[352]

The base is near Novofedorivka, a destination popular with tourists. Traffic backed up at the Crimean Bridge after the explosions with queues of civilians trying to leave the area.\[353] A week later Russia blamed “sabotage” for explosions and a fire at an arms depot near Dzhankoi in northeastern Crimea that also damaged a railway line and power station. Russian regional head Sergei Aksyonov said that 2,000 people were evacuated from the area.\[354] On 18 August, explosions were reported at Belbek Air Base north of Sevastopol.\[355] On the morning of 8 October 2022 the Kerch Bridge, linking occupied Crimea to Russia, partially collapsed due to an explosion.\[356] On 17 July 2023, there was another large explosion on the bridge.\[357] On 3 June 2025, an attack with underwater explosives damaged the foundations of the bridge; traffic resumed within hours.\[358]

**Russian attacks against Ukrainian civilian infrastructure**

Fires on a combined heat and power plant in Kyiv after Russian missile strikes on 10 October 2022

Since 2022, Russia has carried out strikes on Ukrainian electrical and water systems.\[359] On 6 October 2022 the Ukrainian military reported that 86 Shahed 136 kamikaze drones had been launched by Russian forces, and between 30 September and 6 October Ukrainian forces had destroyed 24 out of 46 launched.\[360] On 8 October, it was announced that General of the Army Sergey Surovikin would be commanding all Russian forces on the strength of his novel air assault technique.\[361] On 16 October, The Washington Post reported that Iran was planning to supply Russia with drones and missiles.\[362] On 18 October the US State Department accused Iran of violating Resolution 2231 by selling Shahed 131 and Shahed 136 drones to Russia,\[363] agreeing with France and the UK. Iran denied sending arms for the Ukraine war.\[364] On 22 October France, Britain and Germany formally called for a UN investigation.\[365] On 1 November, CNN reported that Iran was preparing to send ballistic missiles and other weapons to Russia for use in Ukraine.\[366]

On 15 November, Russia fired 85 missiles at the Ukrainian power grid, causing power outages in Kyiv and neighboring regions.\[367] In March 2023, The New York Times reported that Russia had used new hypersonic missiles in a massive missile attack on Ukraine. Such missiles are more effective in evading conventional Ukrainian anti-missile defences that had previously proved useful against Russia’s conventional, non-hypersonic missile systems.\[368]

The UK Defense Ministry said strikes against Ukrainian infrastructure are part of Russia’s ‘Strategic Operation for the Destruction of Critically Important Targets’ (SODCIT) military doctrine, intended to demoralise the population and force the Ukrainian leadership to capitulate.\[369] According to the Royal United Services Institute:\[370]

> Russian strikes had cumulatively destroyed 9 gigawatts (GW) of Ukraine’s domestic power generation by mid-June 2024. Peak consumption during the winter of 2023 was 18 GW, which means that half of Ukraine’s production capacity has been destroyed.

On 8 July 2024, Russia used a Kh-101 missile\[371] to kill two people and injure 16 at the Okhmatdyt Children’s Hospital in Kyiv.\[372]\[373]\[374]\[375] At least 20 civilians were killed in Kyiv that night.\[376]

**Naval blockade and engagements**

*Main article: Naval warfare in the Russian invasion of Ukraine*

Commemorative stamp about the phrase Russian warship, go fuck yourself!

The Russian Black Sea flagship Moskva was sunk on 14 April 2022, reportedly after being hit by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship missiles.

Ukraine lies on the Black Sea, which has ocean access only through the Turkish-held Bosphorus and Dardanelles straits. On 28 February 2022, Turkey invoked the 1936 Montreux Convention and sealed off the straits to Russian warships that were not registered to Black Sea home bases and returning to their ports of origin. It specifically denied passage through the Turkish Straits to four Russian naval vessels.\[377] On 24 February, the State Border Guard Service of Ukraine announced that Russian Navy ships had begun an attack on Snake Island.\[378] The guided missile cruiser and flagship of the Black Sea Fleet, Moskva and patrol boat Vasily Bykov bombarded the island with deck guns.\[379] The Russian warship identified itself and instructed the Ukrainians on the island to surrender. Their response was “Russian warship, go fuck yourself!”\[380] After the bombardment, a detachment of Russian soldiers landed and took control of Snake Island.\[381] Russia said on 26 February that US drones had supplied intelligence to the Ukrainian navy to help it target Russian warships in the Black Sea. The US denied this.\[382]

By 3 March, Ukrainian forces in Mykolaiv scuttled the frigate Hetman Sahaidachny, the flagship of the Ukrainian navy, to prevent its capture by Russian forces.\[383] On 24 March, Ukrainian officials said that a Russian landing ship docked in Berdiansk—initially reported to be the Orsk and then its sister ship, the Saratov—was destroyed by a Ukrainian rocket attack.\[159]\[384] In March 2022, the UN International Maritime Organization (IMO) sought to create a safe sea corridor for commercial vessels to leave Ukrainian ports.\[385] On 27 March, Russia established a sea corridor 80 miles (130 km) long and 3 miles (4.8 km) wide through its Maritime Exclusion Zone, for the transit of merchant vessels from the edge of Ukrainian territorial waters southeast of Odesa.\[386]\[387]

The Moskva was, according to Ukrainian sources and a US senior official,\[388] hit on 13 April by two Ukrainian Neptune anti-ship cruise missiles, setting the ship afire. The Russian Defence Ministry said the warship had suffered serious damage from a munition explosion caused by a fire, and that its entire crew had been evacuated.\[389] Pentagon spokesman John Kirby reported on 14 April that satellite images showed that the Russian warship had suffered a sizeable explosion onboard but was heading to the east for expected repairs and refitting in Sevastopol.\[390] Later the same day, the Russian Ministry of Defence stated that the Moskva had sunk while under tow in rough weather.\[391] On 15 April, Reuters reported that Russia launched an apparent retaliatory missile strike against the missile factory Luch Design Bureau in Kyiv where the Neptune missiles used in the Moskva attack were manufactured and designed.\[392] On 5 May, a US official confirmed that the US gave “a range of intelligence” (including real-time battlefield targeting intelligence)\[393] to assist in the sinking of the Moskva.\[394]

On 1 June, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov asserted that Ukraine’s policy of mining its own harbours to impede Russian maritime aggression had contributed to the food export crisis, saying: “If Kyiv solves the problem of demining ports, the Russian Navy will ensure the unimpeded passage of ships with grain to the Mediterranean Sea.”\[395] On 23 July, CNBC reported a Russian missile strike on the Ukrainian port of Odesa, swiftly condemned by world leaders amid a recent UN- and Turkish-brokered deal to secure a sea corridor for exports of grains and other foodstuffs.\[396]

On 26 December 2023, Ukraine’s air force attacked the Russian landing ship Novocherkassk docked in Feodosia. Ukraine said it was destroyed—unlikely to sail again. Russian authorities confirmed the attack, but not the loss, and said two attacking aircraft were destroyed. Independent analysts said the ship’s loss could hamper future Russian attacks on Ukraine’s coast.\[397]\[398]\[399] On 31 January 2024, Ukrainian sea drones struck the Russian Tarantul-class corvette Ivanovets in the Black Sea, causing the ship to sink.\[400]\[401] Two weeks later on 14 February, the same type of Ukrainian sea drones struck and sank the Russian landing ship Tsezar Kunikov.\[402]\[403]

**Ukrainian resistance**

Civilians in Kyiv preparing Molotov cocktails, 26 February 2022

Ukrainian civilians resisted the Russian invasion by volunteering for territorial defence units, making Molotov cocktails, donating food, building barriers like Czech hedgehogs,\[404] and helping to transport refugees.\[405] Responding to a call from Ukravtodor, Ukraine’s transportation agency, civilians dismantled or altered road signs,\[406] constructed makeshift barriers, and blocked roadways.\[407] Social media reports showed spontaneous street protests against Russian forces in occupied settlements, often evolving into verbal altercations and physical standoffs with Russian troops.\[408] By the beginning of April, Ukrainian civilians began to organise as guerrillas, mostly in the wooded north and east of the country. The Ukrainian military announced plans for a large-scale guerrilla campaign to complement its conventional defence.\[409]

People physically blocked Russian military vehicles, sometimes forcing them to retreat.\[408]\[410] The Russian soldiers’ response to unarmed civilian resistance varied from reluctance to engage the protesters,\[408] to firing into the air, to firing directly into crowds.\[411] There have been mass detentions of Ukrainian protesters, and Ukrainian media has reported forced disappearances, mock executions, hostage-taking, extrajudicial killings, and sexual violence perpetrated by the Russian military.\[412] To facilitate Ukrainian attacks, civilians reported Russian military positions via a Telegram chatbot and Diia, a Ukrainian government app previously used by citizens to upload official identity and medical documents. In response, Russian forces began destroying mobile phone network equipment, searching door-to-door for smartphones and computers, and in at least one case killed a civilian who had pictures of Russian tanks.\[413]

As of 21 May 2022, Zelenskyy indicated that Ukraine had 700,000 service members on active duty fighting the Russian invasion.\[414] Ukraine withdrew soldiers and military equipment back to Ukraine over the course of 2022 that had been deployed to United Nations peacekeeping missions like MONUSCO in the Democratic Republic of the Congo.\[415]

In response to the invasion, many countries have supplied military aid to Ukraine including weaponry, equipment, training, and logistical support. Western and other countries imposed limited sanctions on Russia in the prelude to the invasion and applied new sanctions when the invasion began, intending to cripple the Russian economy;\[416]\[417] sanctions targeted individuals, banks, businesses, monetary exchanges, exports, and imports.\[416]

Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy and Western leaders at the NATO Summit in Vilnius on 12 July 2023

Military assistance has mostly been co-ordinated through the Ukraine Defence Contact Group, whose more than fifty countries include all 32 member states of NATO.\[418] From January 2022 to January 2024, US \$380 billion in aid to Ukraine was tracked by the Kiel Institute.\[419] European countries have provided the most aid in total (military, financial and humanitarian).\[420] Estonia and Denmark have provided the most military aid as a share of GDP.\[421] The European Union co-ordinated the supply of military aid for the first time.\[422] Meanwhile, the United States has provided the most military assistance to Ukraine,\[420] and has set aside US \$175 billion to help the country.\[421] Most of the US military aid has been old American weaponry and equipment from reserve stockpiles, while most of the US funding earmarked for Ukraine stays in the US economy and supports US industries, subsidizing the manufacture of weapons and military equipment.\[421]\[423] Bulgaria supplied Ukraine with over one third of the ammunition needed in the early phase of the invasion and a plurality of needed fuel.\[424]

Although India has maintained a neutral stance on the invasion,\[425] reports indicate that artillery shells made by Indian manufacturers were sold to European countries and then diverted to Ukraine. Indian officials have not intervened despite objections from Russia.\[426]

Most of Ukraine’s supporters ruled out sending troops to the country in the early months of the invasion.\[427] President Emmanuel Macron of France later said in 2024 that sending troops was a possibility.\[428]

The Russian government has threatened retaliation against countries supplying military aid to Ukraine, and said it meant NATO was waging a proxy war against Russia.\[429] According to the Atlantic Council’s Peter Dickinson, Russia’s government has not followed through on its threats, despite most of its “red lines” being crossed.\[430] President Putin said that if military aid stopped, Ukraine would not survive for long.\[431]

In a 3 May 2025 interview for The Times, Ralph Goff, a former chief of operations at the CIA, said that the Biden administration gave Ukraine just enough weapons to bleed, but not to win, adding that “\[They] allowed themselves to be bamboozled by Vladimir Putin and his nuclear-sabre rattling.”\[432]\[433]

Belarus has allowed Russia to use its territory to stage part of the invasion, and to launch Russian missiles into Ukraine.\[434] Belarus airspace was used by Russia, including for radar early warning and control missions, until 2023, when a Russian Beriev A-50 surveillance plane was damaged by drones.\[435] Because of its active involvement, Belarus is considered a co-belligerent\[436]\[437] in this invasion, as contrasted to non-belligerent states, which have “a wide range of tools available to non-belligerent actors without reaching the threshold of warfighting”.\[438] Political scientist Matthew Frear considers Belarus a co-combatant, with “Lukashenko repeatedly stated his support for Putin’s military actions”,\[439] while 2023 issue of IISS’s “Armed Conflict Survey” journal classified it as not a direct co-combatant.\[440] Belarus provided Russia with weapons and ammunition, and later, according to the 2024 issue of “Armed Conflict Survey”, Russia deployed tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.\[441]

**Iran**

*See also: Iran and the Russian invasion of Ukraine*

In June 2023, US military intelligence suggested Iran was providing both Shahed combat drones and production materials to develop a drone manufactory to Russia.\[442] In February 2024, a Reuters report indicated that Iran sent ballistic missiles to the Russian military.\[443] According to the US and Ukraine, Iranian troops have been stationed in Crimea to assist Russia in launching drone attacks against civilians and civilian infrastructure.\[444]\[445] The Institute for the Study of War assessed that these are likely Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps (IRGC) or IRGC-affiliated personnel.\[446] Iran has denied sending arms to Russia for use against Ukraine.\[364]

**North Korea**

*See also: North Korean involvement in the Russian invasion of Ukraine*

North Korea has supplied Russia with ballistic missiles and launchers, US authorities have not stated which specific models. Debris left by missiles in December 2023 attacks against Ukrainian targets, show parts common to Hwasong-11A (KN-23), Hwasong-11B (KN-24) and KN-25 missiles.\[447]\[448] In October 2024, Ukraine and South Korea claimed North Korean engineers had been deployed to the battlefield to help with the launch of these missiles, and suffered casualties.\[449]\[450]\[451]

Later the same month, a White House spokesperson said the US was “concerned” about reports North Korean soldiers were fighting for Russia.\[452]\[453]\[454] Zelensky announced that Ukrainian intelligence believed there were 10,000 North Korean troops preparing to join Russian forces.\[455] The North Korean government stated that none of their soldiers were fighting for Russia.\[456]\[457]\[458]

The US later said it had seen evidence that North Korea had sent 3,000 soldiers to Russia for possible deployment to Ukraine, determining that the soldiers had been transported by ship in October and were undergoing training at three military bases in eastern Russia. The US added that the alleged North Korean deployment could be further evidence that the Russian military was having problems with manpower.\[459] On 28 October, NATO chief Mark Rutte confirmed earlier Ukrainian intelligence that North Korean troops had been deployed to Kursk Oblast to support Russia against the Kursk offensive (2024–2025), and the Pentagon reported an increased number of 10,000 North Korean soldiers sent.\[460]\[461]\[462]

Russian Defence Minister Andrey Belousov with North Korean Defence Minister No Kwang-chol on 29 November 2024

On 7 November, Ukraine’s defence minister reported that North Korean troops had been engaged in battle on 5 November.\[463] On 13 November, the US State Department and South Korea confirmed that North Korean troops had begun engaging in combat against Ukrainian forces in Kursk Oblast.\[464]\[465]\[466]\[467] On 24 November, the Ukrainian chief of general staff confirmed that North Korean troops had been engaged in battle.\[468] On 2 December the Pentagon stated that it had no evidence of North Korean troops engaged in combat, but noted that North Korean soldiers had been integrated into Russian units.\[469] The Ukrainian intelligence directorate confirmed that North Korean troops have been integrated into Russian units held in reserve, but said North Korean troops were unlikely to be engaged in combat and were still engaged in training.\[470] On 16 December, the US confirmed that North Korean troops had been killed in combat in Russia’s Kursk oblast.\[471] By 18 December, the number of killed and wounded North Korean soldiers had reportedly reached a couple of hundred,\[472] while South Korea reported 100 North Koreans dead and 1000 injured.\[473] US Army JAG officers Steve Szymanski and Joshua Keruski stated that North Korea had become a party to an international armed conflict with Ukraine as of the 5 November engagement.\[474]

Zelenskyy showcased footage which he said showed Russian troops burning the faces of killed North Korean soldiers in an attempt to conceal their presence on the battlefield.\[475]\[476]\[477]\[478]

In January 2025, two North Korean servicemen were taken prisoner while fighting in Kursk Oblast. Intelligence debriefings indicate that North Korean soldiers have been issued with false military papers stating that they are Russians hailing from Tuva.\[479] In March 2025, South Korea’s Joint Chiefs of Staff said that North Korea had sent an additional 3,000 soldiers early in the year, along with military equipment including short-range ballistic missiles to support Russia. According to South Korea, roughly 11,000 North Korean soldiers had been sent to Russia, 4,000 of them being killed or wounded.\[480] The same month, Russia acknowledged the presence of North Korean soldiers helping its forces in Kursk for the first time, with Valery Gerasimov specifically expressing gratitude to North Korean troops for assisting in “liberating border areas of the Kursk Region”.\[481]

Politico reported in March 2023 that Chinese state-owned weapons manufacturer Norinco shipped assault rifles, drone parts, and body armor to Russia between June and December 2022, with some shipments via third countries including Turkey and the United Arab Emirates.\[483] According to the United States, Chinese ammunition has been used on battlefields in Ukraine.\[484] In May 2023, the European Union identified that Chinese and UAE firms were supplying weapon components to Russia.\[485] In April 2024, China was reported to have provided Russia with geospatial intelligence, machine tools for tanks, and propellants for missiles.\[486] In September 2024, Reuters reported documents indicating Russia had established a weapons programme in China to develop and produce long-range attack drones, with assistance from local specialists, for use in the invasion of Ukraine.\[487]

Russia imports sensitive electronics, machinery, auto parts, and defence equipment from India.\[488] Trade like oil sales has surged since 2022, boosting revenue for Russian state-owned companies. To bypass sanctions and manage its currency surplus, Russia pays in rupees, supporting both civilian and military needs.\[489]\[490]

Russian and Ukrainian sources have been said to inflate casualty numbers for opposing forces and downplay their own losses for morale.\[491] Leaked US documents say “under-reporting of casualties within the \[Russian] system highlights the military’s ‘continuing reluctance’ to convey bad news up the chain of command.”\[492] Russian news outlets have largely stopped reporting the Russian death toll.\[493] Russia and Ukraine have admitted suffering “significant”\[494] and “considerable” losses, respectively.\[495]\[496]

The numbers of civilian and military deaths have been impossible to determine precisely.\[497] Agence France-Presse (AFP) reported that neither it nor independent conflict monitors could verify Russian and Ukrainian claims of enemy losses and suspected they were inflated.\[498] In October 2022, the independent Russian media project iStories, citing sources close to the Kremlin, reported that more than 90,000 Russian soldiers had been killed, seriously wounded, or gone missing.\[499]

While combat deaths can be inferred from a variety of sources, including satellite imagery of military action, measuring civilian deaths is more difficult. In June 2022, the Ukrainian Minister of Defence told CNN that tens of thousands of Ukrainians had died, and he hoped the death toll was below 100,000.\[500] By July 2024, about 20,000 Ukrainians had lost limbs.\[501] In the destroyed city of Mariupol, Ukrainian officials believe at least 25,000 have been killed,\[502]\[503] and bodies were still being discovered in September 2022.\[504] The mayor said over 10,000 and possibly as many as 20,000 civilians died in the siege of Mariupol and Russian forces had brought mobile cremation equipment with them when they entered the city.\[505]\[506]\[507] An investigation by AP from the end of 2022 estimated up to 75,000 killed civilians in the Mariupol area alone.\[508]\[509] AFP says “a key gap in casualty counts is the lack of information from Russian-occupied places like the port city of Mariupol, where tens of thousands of civilians are believed to have died”.\[510] There were at least 8,000 excess deaths in Mariupol between March 2022–February 2023.\[511] The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR) reports similar issues and believed the true civilian casualty numbers were significantly higher than it has been able to confirm.\[512]

In the Russian military, ethnic minorities have suffered disproportionately high casualties. In October 2022, the Russian regions with the highest death tolls were Dagestan, Tuva and Buryatia, all minority regions. In February 2024, six out of ten Russian regions with the highest mortality rates in Ukraine were located in Siberia and the far east, and ethnic minorities continuing outsized casualty rates prompted analysts to warn that the situation will lead to long-term destructive impacts on these communities.\[513]\[514]\[515]\[516]\[517] About 1,200 Russian soldiers were killed or wounded in Ukraine every day in May–June 2024,\[518] which climbed to 1,500 by November 2024, when 45,690 casualties were estimated that month.\[519] Newsweek estimated that on the bloodiest day in November 2024 the ratio of killed Russian men (1,950) exceeded the average daily male birth rate in Russia (1,836).\[520] Latvia-based news outlet Meduza estimated that up to 140,000 Russian soldiers had died by July 2024.\[521]

The Russian invasion became the deadliest European war in the last 80 years,\[522] surpassing the Bosnian War.\[523] Ukrainian average mortality rate was 8.7/1000 people in 2020,\[524] and jumped to 18.6 in 2024, whereas Russia’s mortality rate was 14/1000, ranking them as #1 and #9, of countries with the highest mortality rates.\[525] In August 2024, Haaretz estimated 172,000 people had died in the Russian invasion.\[526] In February 2025, Quincy Institute for Responsible Statecraft estimated 250,000 dead.\[527] In September 2024, the Wall Street Journal reported that there were now one million Ukrainians and Russians who were killed or wounded; it noted how the number of casualties impacts the countries’ shrinking prewar populations.\[528]

**War crimes and attacks on civilians**

*Main articles: War crimes in the Russian invasion of Ukraine; Attacks on civilians in the Russian invasion of Ukraine; Russian war crimes*

Dead bodies following the Bucha massacre

During the invasion, the Russian military and authorities have been responsible for deliberate attacks against civilian targets\[557] (including strikes on hospitals and on the energy grid), massacres of civilians, abduction and torture of civilians, sexual violence,\[558] forced deportation of civilians, and torture and murder of Ukrainian prisoners of war. They have also carried out many indiscriminate attacks in densely populated areas, including with cluster bombs, in one instance killing 61 people in the Kramatorsk railway station attack.\[559]\[560]\[561]\[199] According to Kyrylo Budanov, the chief of the Ukrainian intelligence, Russia before the start of the invasion of Ukraine had created ‘execution lists’ of Ukrainian teachers, journalists, scientists, writers, priests, politicians and was preparing for a genocide of Ukrainians, also the plans included locations of mass graves and mobile crematoriums.\[562]

According to the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, by December 2023, about 78 % of confirmed civilian casualties had been killed in Ukrainian-controlled territory, while 21 % had been killed in Russian-occupied territory.\[563] Over 12,300 civilians have been killed since the start of the invasion.\[564] Russia has deliberately targeted Ukrainian civilians with drones, such as in the Kherson terror campaign dubbed the human safari.\[565]\[566]\[567] In May 2025, the UN concluded that the recurrent Russian attacks on civilians in Kherson, which had killed nearly 150 people and injured hundreds more according to officials, amount to war crimes and crimes against humanity.\[568]

The UN Human Rights Office reports that Russia is committing severe human rights violations in occupied Ukraine, including arbitrary detentions, enforced disappearances, torture, crackdown on protests and freedom of speech, enforced Russification, indoctrination of children, and suppression of Ukrainian language and culture.\[569] Ukrainians have been coerced into taking Russian passports and becoming Russian citizens. Those who refuse are denied healthcare and other rights,\[569] and can be imprisoned as a “foreign citizen”. Ukrainian men who take Russian citizenship are drafted to fight against the Ukrainian army.\[570]

Russian forces have reportedly used banned chemical weapons during the war, usually tear gas grenades.\[571]\[572] In April 2024, a Daily Telegraph investigation concluded that “Russian troops are carrying out a systematic campaign of illegal chemical attacks against Ukrainian soldiers”.\[573]

**Prisoners of war**

*Main article: Prisoners of war in the Russian invasion of Ukraine*

A 25 August 2022 report by the Humanitarian Research Lab of the Yale School of Public Health identified some 21 filtration camps for Ukrainian “civilians, POWs, and other personnel” in the vicinity of Donetsk oblast. Imaging of one camp, Olenivka prison, found two sites featuring disturbed earth consistent with “potential graves”.\[574] Kaveh Khoshnood, a professor at the Yale School of Public Health, said: “Incommunicado detention of civilians is more than a violation of international humanitarian law—it represents a threat to the public health of those currently in the custody of Russia and its proxies.” Conditions described by freed prisoners include exposure, insufficient access to sanitation, food and water, cramped conditions, electrical shocks and physical assault.\[574]

An OHCHR report released in November 2022 documented abuses on both sides. The report was based on interviews with prisoners who spoke of abuses and ill-treatment.\[575]

In March 2023, UN human rights commissioner Volker Türk reported that more than 90 % of the Ukrainian POWs interviewed by his office said they had been tortured or ill-treated, including ″welcoming beatings″ on their arrival in penitentiary facilities, which Russia despite several requests did not give UN staff access to.\[576]

In April 2023, several videos started circulating on different websites purportedly showing Russian soldiers beheading Ukrainian soldiers.\[577]\[578]

In March 2024, the United Nations issued a report saying Russia may have executed more than 30 recently captured Ukrainian prisoners of war over the winter months. The UN Human Rights Office verified three incidents in which Russian servicemen executed seven Ukrainian servicemen. According to the same report, 39 of 60 released Ukrainian prisoners of war also “disclosed that they had been subjected to sexual violence during their internment, including attempted rape, threats of rape and castration, beatings or the administration of electric shocks to genitals, and repeated forced nudity, including during interrogations and to check for tattoos”.\[579]

In October 2024, the EEAS released a statement describing the increasing frequency of Russian executions of Ukrainian prisoners, with at least 177 prisoners dying in Russian captivity since the beginning of the war. The statement also included the Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights (OHCHR)’s confirmation of systematic use of a wide range of different methods of torture used by Russians against Ukrainian prisoners.\[580]

The Ukrainian Armed Forces have also been accused of executions and other abuses of Russian prisoners of war, but the number of such allegations has been significantly lower.\[581]: para. 105 \[582]\[583]\[584]

**Abduction of Ukrainian children**

*Main article: Child abductions in the Russo-Ukrainian War*

In June 2024, an investigation by the Financial Times identified four Ukrainian children on a Russian government-linked adoption website that had been abducted from state care homes. The children’s Ukrainian background was not mentioned. One child was shown with a new Russian name and age that differed from their Ukrainian documents, another was shown using a Russian version of their Ukrainian name. 17 other matches identified by the Financial Times on the adoption website were also confirmed as Ukrainian children in a recent New York Times investigation. Ukrainian authorities estimate that nearly 20,000 Ukrainian children have been forcibly taken from occupied territories to Russia since the full-scale invasion began. Wayne Jordash, president of humanitarian law firm Global Rights Compliance, described forcibly transferring or deporting children as war crimes, adding that when done as part of a widespread or systematic attack on a civilian population, Russia is also committing crimes against humanity.\[585]\[586]

In March 2025, the ISW said that by the time the invasion started, Russia had already laid the groundwork for massive deportation of Ukrainian children, with Putin recognizing depriving Ukraine of its multigenerational potential a way to dominate the Ukrainian people. ISW cited Kremlin documents uncovered by Ukrainian human rights activists dated 18 February 2022, describing plans to move Ukrainian children from orphanages in occupied Donetsk and Luhansk oblasts to Russia under ″humanitarian evacuations″, particularly planning to target vulnerable children without parental care. In the years following the invasion, Russia has embarked on a deeply institutionalized project to abduct and forcibly give Ukrainian children a Russian identity. International law explicitly forbids this kind of forcible transfer of children, and constituent moving children for the purpose of damaging a national or ethnic group as an act of genocide.\[587]

**International arrest warrants**

The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into possible crimes against humanity, genocide and war crimes committed in Ukraine.\[588] On 17 March 2023, the ICC issued a warrant for Putin’s arrest, charging him with individual criminal responsibility in the abduction of children forcibly deported to Russia.\[589] It was the first time that the ICC had issued an arrest warrant for the head of state of a permanent member of the United Nations Security Council\[589] (the world’s five principal nuclear powers).\[590] Moscow has denied any involvement in war crimes, a response Vittorio Bufacchi of University College Cork says “has bordered on the farcical”,\[591] and its contention that the images coming out of Bucha were fabricated “a disingenuous response born by delusional hubris, post-truth on overdrive, (that) does not merit to be taken seriously.” Even the usually fractured United States Senate came together to call Putin a war criminal.\[592]

One of several efforts to document Russian war crimes concerns its repeated bombardment of markets and bread lines, destruction of basic infrastructure and attacks on exports and supply convoys, in a country where deliberate starvation of Ukrainians by Soviets the Holodomor still looms large in public memory.\[593] Forcible deportation of populations, such as took place in Mariupol, is another area of focus, since,\[594]

> forced deportations and transfers are defined both as war crimes under the Fourth Geneva Convention and Protocol II and Article 8 of the Rome Statute—and as crimes against humanity—under Article 7 of the Rome Statute. As both war crimes and crimes against humanity, they have several mechanisms for individual accountability, the International Criminal Court and also, at the individual state level, universal jurisdiction and Magnitsky sanctions legislation.

The ICC also issued arrest warrants for military officials Sergey Kobylash, Viktor Sokolov, Sergei Shoigu and Valery Gerasimov.\[595]\[596]

**Impacts**

**Humanitarian impact**

*Main article: Humanitarian impacts of the Russian invasion of Ukraine*

The invasion contributed to the 2022 food crises.\[597] As of February 2025, 3.7 million Ukrainians were internally displaced and 6.9 million were refugees.\[598]

Russian attacks on civilians, causing mass civilian casualties and displacement, have been characterised as genocide and democide.\[26]\[27]\[28]\[29] In September 2023, a UN-mandated investigative body reported that Russian occupiers had tortured Ukrainians to death, and forced families to listen as they raped women next door.\[599] The commission previously found that violations committed by Russian forces in Ukraine may constitute crimes against humanity.\[600]

By August 2024, the WHO had recorded 1,940 attacks against Ukrainian health care and reported widespread double-tap attacks.\[601] In 2023, Physicians for Human Rights described Russian attacks on Ukraine’s health care system as having a “reasonable basis” to be considered war crimes, and could potentially constitute crimes against humanity.\[602]

**Cultural heritage**

*Main article: Ukrainian culture during the Russian invasion of Ukraine*

Deliberate destruction and looting of cultural heritage sites is a war crime; during armed conflict, it is an act of aggression.\[603] As of April 2025, UNESCO has verified damage to 485 Ukrainian cultural sites, including 149 religious sites, 34 museums, 33 monuments, and 18 libraries.\[604] In 2022, the European Parliament labelled Russia’s destruction of Ukrainian cultural property a war crime.\[605] Ukraine’s Minister of Culture Oleksandr Tkachenko called it cultural genocide.\[606]

**Refugee crisis**

*Main articles: Ukrainian refugee crisis; Transnational repression by Russia*

Ukrainian refugees in Kraków protesting against the war, 6 March 2022

The war has caused the largest refugee and humanitarian crisis in Europe since World War II.\[607] In the first week of the invasion, the UN reported over a million refugees had fled Ukraine; this reached over eight million by February 2023.\[608]\[609] In May 2022, following an influx of military equipment into Ukraine, a significant number of refugees sought to return to regions relatively isolated from the invasion front in southeastern Ukraine.\[610] By 3 May, another 8 million people were displaced inside Ukraine.\[611]

Most refugees were women, children, elderly, or disabled.\[612] Most male Ukrainian nationals aged 18 to 60 were denied exit from Ukraine as part of mandatory conscription,\[613] unless they were responsible for the financial support of three or more children, single fathers, or were the parent/guardian of children with disabilities.\[614] Many Ukrainian men, including teenagers, opted to remain in Ukraine voluntarily to join the resistance.\[615]

According to the UN High Commission for Refugees as of May 2022, there were 3,315,711 refugees in Poland, 901,696 in Romania, 594,664 in Hungary, 461,742 in Moldova, 415,402 in Slovakia, and 27,308 in Belarus, while Russia reported it had received over 800,104 refugees.\[608] By July 2022, over 390,000 Ukrainian refugees had arrived in the Czech Republic, where the average refugee was a woman accompanied by a child. These refugees were twice as likely to have a college degree as the Czech population as a whole.\[616] Turkey registered more than 58,000 Ukrainian refugees as of March 2022.\[617] The EU invoked the Temporary Protection Directive for the first time, granting Ukrainian refugees the right to live and work in the EU for up to three years.\[618] Britain has accepted 146,379 refugees, as well as extending the ability to remain in the UK for three years with broadly similar entitlements as the EU, three years residency and access to state welfare and services.\[619]

According to the Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE), Russia has engaged in “massive deportation” of over 1.3 million Ukrainian civilians, potentially constituting crimes against humanity.\[620] The OSCE and Ukraine have accused Russia of forcibly moving civilians to filtration camps in Russian-held territory, and then into Russia. Ukrainian sources have compared this policy to Soviet-era population transfers and Russian actions in the Chechen War of Independence.\[621] For instance, as of April 2022, Russia claimed to have evacuated about 121,000 Mariupol residents to Russia.\[621]\[622] RIA Novosti and Ukrainian officials said that thousands were dispatched to centres in cities in Russia and Russian-occupied Ukraine,\[623] from which people were sent to economically depressed regions of Russia.\[624]\[625]\[j]

**Long-term demographic effects**

Ukrainian refugees entering Romania, 5 March 2022

Both Russia and Ukraine faced the prospect of significant population decline even before the war, having among the lowest fertility rates worldwide and considerable emigration. It is the first time that two countries with an average age above 40 have gone to war against each other.\[627] Russia had a fighting-age (18-to-40-year-old) male population more than four times higher than Ukraine’s and slightly higher birth rates, while the willingness to fight was more pronounced in Ukraine.\[628]

Several sources have pointed out that the war is considerably worsening Ukraine’s demographic crisis, making significant shrinking very likely.\[629] A July 2023 study by the Vienna Institute for International Economic Studies stated that,\[630]

> regardless of how long the war lasts and whether or not there is further military escalation, Ukraine is unlikely to recover demographically from the consequences of the war. Even in 2040 it will have only about 35 million inhabitants, around 20 % fewer than before the war (2021: 42.8 million) and the decline in the working-age population is likely to be the most severe and far-reaching.

The study took different scenarios, from a “best case” (end of the war in 2023 without much further escalation) to a “worst case” (end of the war in 2025 with further escalation) into account. Flight from war affected especially the southern and eastern regions and especially educated women of child-bearing age and their children. With an estimate of more than 20 % of refugees not returning, study author Maryna Tverdostup concluded that long-term shrinking will significantly impair the conditions for reconstruction.\[630]

Civilians from occupied Crimea drafted into the Russian army during the 2022 Russian mobilization

The war in Ukraine and the associated emigration, lower birth rates and war-related casualties further deepened the demographic crisis of Russia.\[631] Many commentators predict that the situation will be worse than during the 1990s.\[632] The UN is projecting that the decline that started in 2021 will continue, and if current demographic conditions persist, Russia’s population would be 120 million in fifty years, a decline of about 17 %.\[633]\[634]

Since February 2022, hundreds of thousands of Russians have emigrated; estimates range from 370,000 to over 820,000. Combined with mobilisation, this possibly removed roughly half a million to one million working-age males from Russia’s population.\[635] Studies report that this will have a demographic effect, especially in Russia, that lasts much longer than the conflict, and Putin’s time in office.\[636]

According to BBC:\[637]

> They come from different walks of life. Some are journalists like us, but there are also IT experts, designers, artists, academics, lawyers, doctors, PR specialists, and linguists. Most are under 50. Many share western liberal values and hope Russia will be a democratic country one day. Some are LGBTQ+. Sociologists studying the current Russian emigration say there is evidence that those leaving are younger, better educated and wealthier than those staying. More often they are from bigger cities.

According to Johannes Wachs, “The exodus of skilled human capital, sometimes called brain drain, out of Russia may have a significant effect on the course of the war and the Russian economy in the long run.”\[638] According to a survey, around 15 percent of those who left returned to Russia, either permanently or to settle their affairs.\[639]

In November 2023, at the World Russian People’s Council, Putin urged Russian women to have eight or more children amid increasing Russian casualties in the invasion.\[640]

In July 2024, Chief of the General Staff of the British Army Roland Walker said that with the current way of fighting, it would take Russia five years to control the four oblasts of Donetsk, Luhansk, Kherson and Zaporizhzhia that Russia claims as its own, and it would cost Russia from 1.5 to 1.8 million casualties.\[641] He said there are “no winners” in Russia’s invasion, adding “it is an utter devastation for both sides and lost generations.”\[642]

**Environmental impact**

*Main article: Environmental impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine*

An explosion due to the shelling of a tank of nitric acid during the battle of Sievierodonetsk, 31 May 2022

Based on a preliminary assessment, the war has inflicted US \$51 billion in environmental damage in Ukraine; according to a report by the Yale School of the Environment, some 623,000 tonnes (1.4 billion pounds) of petrochemicals have burned as a result of shelling, while nearly 1,500 tonnes (3.2 million pounds) of pollutants have leaked into bodies of water. Hazardous chemicals have contaminated around 28 hectares (70 acres) of soil, and likely made agricultural activities temporarily impossible.\[643] Around 30 % of Ukraine’s land is now littered with explosives and more than 2.4 million hectares (5.9 million acres) of forest have been damaged.\[644]

According to Netherlands-based peace organisation PAX, Russia’s “deliberate targeting of industrial and energy infrastructure” has caused “severe” pollution, and the use of explosive weapons has left “millions of tonnes” of contaminated debris in cities and towns.\[645] In early June 2023, the Kakhovka Dam, under Russian occupation, was damaged, causing flooding and triggering warnings of an “ecological disaster”.\[646]

The Ukrainian government, international observers and journalists have described the damage as ecocide.\[647] The Ukrainian government is investigating more crimes against the environment and ecocide (a crime in Ukraine).\[648] Zelenskyy has met with prominent European figures (Heidi Hautala, Margot Wallstrom, Mary Robinson and Greta Thunberg) to discuss the environmental damage and how to prosecute it.\[649]

According to an investigation by NGL Media published in April 2024, Russia has completely destroyed over 60,000 hectares (150,000 acres) of Ukrainian forests. The investigation stated that long-term ecological consequences may include lowering of the groundwater level, reduction of biodiversity, worsening of air quality, fire outbreaks, and rivers and ponds drying up.\[650]

The war in Ukraine has severely disrupted climate policy all over the world and increased CO₂ emissions.\[651]\[652] The effects have been strongly felt in Asia,\[653]\[654]\[655] Europe,\[656] and the US.\[657] Fatih Birol, the head of the International Energy Agency talking about the prospects of COP 28 noted:\[658]

> ... the geopolitical situation, with many nations at loggerheads over the war in Ukraine, and still frosty relations between the US and China, would make for a difficult summit. \[...] The most important challenge \[to limiting temperature rises to 1.5 °C (2.7 °F) above pre-industrial levels] is the lack of international cooperation.

**Nuclear risk**

*Main article: Nuclear risk during the Russian invasion of Ukraine*

IAEA inspectors recording damage at Zaporizhzhia NPP

Throughout the war, Putin implied that Russia may use nuclear weapons if certain “red lines” were to be crossed. By 2024, most of the Russian government’s “red lines” had been crossed without nuclear weapons being used in response.\[659]

Four days into the invasion, Putin put Russia’s nuclear forces on high alert, raising fears that Russia could use tactical nuclear weapons against Ukraine.\[660] In response to what he called “completely irresponsible actions”, Zelenskyy suggested that there should be “global control” of Russia’s nuclear assets.\[661] In March 2023, Putin announced plans to install Russian tactical nuclear weapons in Belarus.\[662]

The invasion had an impact on Ukraine’s nuclear power plants. Russian forces captured Chernobyl on the first day, leading to a huge spike in radiation levels.\[663] Russia also captured Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant, the largest in Europe, and which has since been at risk and damaged by shelling. In August 2022, Zelenskyy described the situation as “Russian nuclear terror”.\[664] The International Atomic Energy Agency said it was the first time a military conflict occurred amid nuclear plants, and it called for a demilitarised zone around Zaporizhzhia NPP.\[665]

**Economic impact**

*Main article: Economic impact of the Russian invasion of Ukraine*

**Ukraine**

Ukrainian Minister of Economic Development and Trade Yulia Svyrydenko announced that for 2022 Ukraine had a 30 % loss in their gross domestic product (GDP).\[666] The International Monetary Fund predicted that Ukraine’s GDP would suffer a decrease from a minimum of 10 % to a maximum of 35 %;\[667] the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development also predicted that the invasion would cause a 20 % decrease of Ukraine’s GDP.\[668] The Ukrainian statistics service said that the GDP of Ukraine in 2023 grew by 5.3 %.\[669]

Ukraine began issuing war bonds on 1 March 2022, and the following day the Ukrainian government announced that they had raised 6.14 billion hryvnias.\[670] A ban was placed in May 2022 by the European Commission on grain sales in the countries of: Bulgaria, Poland, Hungary, Romania and Slovakia with the only exception being if they were transiting through those countries with the ban being lifted in September 2023.\[671]

The war has caused a major humanitarian crisis in Ukraine: the United Nations Development Programme calculated in March 2022 that a prolonged conflict would cause 30 % of the Ukrainian population to fall below the poverty line, while a further 62 % would be at risk of also falling into poverty within a year.\[672]

**Russia**

The Russian economic ministry said that for 2022 the GDP contracted by 2.1 %\[673] and for 2023 Russia’s government said the GDP grew by 3.6 %.\[674]

A price cap was placed on Russian oil by the Group of 7 (G7) at \$60 on 5 December 2022.\[675] The United States banned all imports of Russian oil on 8 March 2022.\[676] The European Union placed an embargo on oil products from Russia on 5 February 2023.\[675] Other countries that embargoed Russian oil included Five Eyes partners Canada, the United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand.\[677] Russia itself issued a ban on foreign diesel sales starting on 21 September 2023, before being lifted on 6 October.\[678]

On 27 April 2024, it was reported that Russia was planning increases in personal income taxes and corporate taxes to help pay for the war.\[679]

In January 2025, it was reported that, since early 2022, Russia had used a two-prong strategy to finance the extremely large costs of the war. In addition to the official Russian government defense budget—direct financial expenditure for waging the war in Ukraine was estimated at US \$250 billion through June 2024 for military spending through normal channels,\[23] with the military budget rising to over 20 % of annual GDP—an additional off-budget financing mechanism was employed to fund the war with over US \$200 billion of debt funding obtained from preferential bank loans made to defence contractors and war-related businesses, loans that had been compelled by the Russian government.\[24]\[25]

Attendees at the June 2024 Ukraine peace summit

Peace negotiations between Russia and Ukraine took place on 28 February, 3 March, and 7 March 2022, on the Belarus–Ukraine border, with further talks held on 10 March in Turkey and a fourth round of negotiations beginning 14 March.\[680] The talks ended without agreement.

*Putin made recognition of Russian sovereignty over the annexed territories (pictured) a condition for peace talks with Ukraine.*\[681]

In 2024, Ukraine’s main peace terms were that Russia withdraw its troops, that Ukrainian prisoners be released, Russian leaders be prosecuted for war crimes, and Ukraine be given security guarantees to prevent further aggression. Russia’s main terms were that Russia must keep all the land it occupied, that it be given all of the provinces that it claims but does not fully control, that Ukraine end plans to join NATO, and sanctions against Russia be lifted.\[682] According to Western sources, allowing Russia to keep the land it seized would “reward the aggressor while punishing the victim” and set a dangerous precedent.\[683] They predicted this would allow Russia to re-arm and encourage it “to continue its imperialist campaign of expansionism” against Ukraine and other neighbors, and embolden other expansionist regimes.\[683]\[684]\[685]\[686]

After Donald Trump became US president in 2025, there was a major shift in US policy. The Trump administration began negotiations with Russia and separately with Ukraine.

The invasion received widespread international condemnation from governments and intergovernmental organisations.\[687] On 2 March 2022 and on 23 February 2023, 141 member states of the UN General Assembly voted for a resolution saying that Russia should immediately withdraw. Seven, including Russia, voted against the measure.\[688] Political reactions to the invasion included new sanctions imposed on Russia, which triggered widespread economic effects on the Russian and world economies.\[689] Sanctions forced Russia to reorient its oil exports to non-sanctioning countries such as India, rely more on LNG (which was not subject to European Union sanctions), and shift its coal exports from Europe to Asia.\[690] Most European countries cancelled nuclear cooperation with Russia.\[691]

Over 70 sovereign states and the European Union delivered humanitarian aid to Ukraine, and nearly 50 countries plus the EU provided military aid.\[692] Economic sanctions included a ban on Russian aircraft using EU airspace,\[693] a ban of certain Russian banks from the SWIFT international payments system, and a ban on certain Russian media outlets.\[694] Reactions to the invasion have included public response, media responses, peace efforts, and the examination of the legal implications of the invasion.

Some countries, particularly in the Global South, saw public sympathy or outright support for Russia, due in part to distrust of US foreign policy.\[695] Protests and demonstrations were held worldwide, including some in Russia and parts of Ukraine occupied by Russia.\[696] Calls for a boycott of Russian goods spread on social media platforms,\[697] while hackers attacked Russian websites, particularly those operated by the Russian government.\[698] Anti-Russian sentiment against Russians living abroad surged after the invasion.\[699] In March 2022, Russian President Putin introduced prison sentences of up to 15 years for publishing “fake news” about Russian military operations,\[700] intended to suppress any criticism related to the war.\[701]

According to the Economist Intelligence Unit in 2023, 31 percent of the world’s population live in countries that are leaning towards or supportive of Russia, 30.7 percent live in neutral countries, and 36.2 percent live in countries that are against Russia in some way.\[702]

A number of supranational and national parliaments passed resolutions declaring Russia to be a state sponsor of terrorism.\[703] By October 2022, three countries—Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia—had declared Russia a terrorist state.\[704] On 1 August 2023, Iceland became the first European country to close its embassy in Russia as a result of the invasion of Ukraine.\[705]

The invasion prompted Ukraine,\[706] Finland and Sweden to officially apply for NATO membership.\[707] Finland became a member of NATO on 4 April 2023,\[708] followed by Sweden on 7 March 2024.\[709]

Get in-depth coverage about Russia’s war on Ukraine.

Why Ukraine?

Learn the history behind the conflict and what Russian President Vladimir Putin has said about his war aims.

The stakes of Putin’s war

Russia’s invasion has the potential to set up a clash of nuclear world powers. It’s destabilizing the region and terrorizing Ukrainian citizens. It could also impact inflation, gas prices, and the global economy.

How other countries are responding

The US and its European allies have responded to Putin’s aggression with unprecedented sanctions, but have no plans to send troops to Ukraine, for good reason.

How to help

On March 4, Russia seized Zaporizhzhia, one of Europe’s largest nuclear power plants. Russian shelling of the southeastern Ukraine facility set off a fire, which Ukrainian officials warned could set off a nuclear disaster. It took hours, but the fire was extinguished, and international monitors said that they do not detect elevated radiation levels and that the fire did not damage “essential” equipment. US officials have said Russia now appears to be in control of the plant.

But the incident was a reminder of how dangerous this war in Ukraine is becoming, and how uncertain and confusing things still are on the ground. Russian troops were advancing toward Kyiv, and thousands and thousands are fleeing in advance of a possible siege on the city.

The Russian military has made advances in the south, and are gaining in the area of Kherson, a port city on the Black Sea whose control is reportedly contested, and Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov. Russian bombardment of these cities has resulted in humanitarian issues, with bridges and roads damaged by the fighting and dwindling access to food, clean water, medicine, and electricity in certain areas. Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city, experienced heavy Russian fire this week, and strikes have heavily damaged residential areas.

Ukrainian and Russian officials met in early March, and tentatively agreed on the need for humanitarian corridors — basically, safe zones for civilians to flee and supplies to pass through — but did not reach agreements on a larger ceasefire. As of March 6, multiple attempts to evacuate Ukrainian civilians have been halted because of Russian shelling.

Putin’s attempt to redraw the map of Europe risks becoming the most devastating conflict on the continent since World War II. Already, it is causing an astounding humanitarian crisis: Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of civilians have died, and more than 1.5 million people have fled the violence so far, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, making it the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.

The battle for Ukraine began in the early morning hours, local time, on February 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched what he called a “special military operation” into the country of about 40 million. He claimed the Russian military seeks “demilitarization and denazification” but not occupation; attacks shortly followed from multiple fronts and targeted toward multiple cities.",russia-ukraine-invasion,vox.txt
"After 3 months, Russia still bogged down in Ukraine war",THE ASSOCIATED PRESS,https://apnews.com/article/russia-ukraine-putin-kyiv-politics-9e0c72aa16d97d7466f22dfbf6dc8fa0,"May 24, 2022","When Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, it had hoped to overtake the country in a blitz lasting only days or a few weeks. Many Western analysts thought so, too.

As the conflict marked its third month Tuesday, however, Moscow appears to be bogged down in what increasingly looks like a war of attrition, with no end in sight and few successes on the battlefield.

There was no quick victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin’s powerful forces, no rout that would allow the Kremlin to control most of Ukraine and establish a puppet government.

Instead, Russian troops got bogged down on the outskirts of Kyiv and other big cities amid stiff Ukrainian defenses. Convoys of Russian armor seemed stalled on long stretches of highway. Troops ran out of supplies and gasoline, becoming easy targets.

A little over a month into the invasion, Russia effectively acknowledged the failure of its blitz and pulled troops back from areas near Kyiv, declaring a shift of focus to the eastern industrial region of the Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.

To be sure, Russia has seized significant chunks of territory around the Crimean Peninsula that Moscow annexed eight years ago. It also has managed to cut Ukraine off completely from the Sea of Azov, finally securing full control over the key port of Mariupol after a siege that prevented some of its troops from fighting elsewhere while they battled diehard Ukrainian forces.

But the offensive in the east seems to have bogged down as well, as Western arms flow into Ukraine to bolster its outgunned army.

Russian artillery and warplanes relentlessly pound Ukrainian positions, trying to break through defenses built up during the separatist conflict. They have made only incremental gains, clearly reflecting both Russia’s insufficient troop numbers and the Ukrainian resistance. Russia recently lost hundreds of personnel and dozens of combat vehicles while trying to cross a river to build a bridgehead.

“The Russians are still well behind where we believe they wanted to be when they started this revitalized effort in the eastern part of the country,” Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Friday, adding that small towns and villages were changing hands every day in the Donbas.

Elsewhere in Ukraine, Russian forces have methodically targeted Western weapons shipments, ammunition and fuel depots, and critical infrastructure in hopes of weakening Kyiv’s military and economy.

But in trying to gain ground, Russian forces have also relentlessly shelled cities and laid siege to some of them. In the latest example of the war’s toll, 200 bodies were found in a collapsed building in Mariupol, Ukrainian authorities said Tuesday.

The Kremlin appears to still harbor a more ambitious goal of cutting off Ukraine from the Black Sea coast all the way to the Romanian border, a move that would also give Moscow a land corridor to Moldova’s separatist region of Transnistria, where Russian troops are stationed.

But Russia seems to know that this objective is not currently achievable with the limited forces it has.

“I think they’re just increasingly realizing that they can’t necessarily do all of it, certainly not at one go,” said Justin Crump, a former British tank commander who heads Sibylline, a strategic advisory firm.

Moscow’s losses have forced it to rely increasingly on hastily patched-together units in the Donbas that could only make small gains, he said.

“It’s a constant downshifting of gear toward smaller objectives that Russia can actually achieve,” Crump said. “And I think on the biggest scale, they’ve actually downsized their strategy better to match their their ability on the ground.”

Two top officials appeared to acknowledge Tuesday the advance has been slower than expected. Secretary of Russia’s Security Council Nikolai Patrushev said it “is not chasing deadlines,” and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the pace was deliberate to allow civilians to flee, even though forces have repeatedly hit civilian targets.

Many in Ukraine and the West thought Putin would pour resources into the Donbas to score a decisive triumph by Victory Day on May 9, when Moscow celebrates its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Russia has falsely called the war a campaign to “denazify” Ukraine — a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.

Rather than a massive campaign, however, the Kremlin opted for tactical mini-offensives, aimed at steadily trying to encircle Ukrainian forces.

“The Russian leadership is urging the military command to show at least some gains, and it has nothing else to do but to keep sending more troops into the carnage,” said Mykola Sunhurovskyi, a military expert at the Kyiv-based Razumkov Center think tank.

Many in the West expected Putin to declare a broad troop mobilization, with British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace saying he might do it on Victory Day. That never happened, with Russia continuing to rely on a limited force that was clearly insufficient.

A massive mobilization would likely foment discontent in Russia, fuel antiwar sentiment and carry political risks. Authorities opted for more limited options, with lawmakers drafting a bill to waive the current age limit of 40 for those willing to sign up for the military.

The lack of resources was underlined last week by an abrupt Russian withdrawal from areas near Kharkiv, Ukraine’s second-largest city that has been bombarded since the war began. Some of those forces apparently were redeployed to the Donbas, but it wasn’t enough to tip the scales.

“They really had to thin out the troops they had around Kharkiv, simply because they’re trying to hold to too much of a line with too few troops,” said Phillips O’Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.

The Donbas fighting has increasingly become artillery duels, and “it might go on for quite a long time without much movement in the lines,” he said.

“So it will be a more of a positional battle at that point, O’Brien added, with success going to whoever “can take the pounding.”

Ukraine, meanwhile, continues to get a steady flow of Western arms, including U.S. howitzers and drones, tanks from Poland and other heavy gear that is immediately sent into combat.

“Ukraine’s plan is simple and obvious — wear down the Russian forces in the nearest months as much as possible, win time for receiving Western weapons and training how to use them, and then launch a counteroffensive in the southeast,” said Sunhurovskyi, the Kyiv-based military expert.

He said Ukraine hopes to receive even more powerful Western weapons, such as U.S. HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, anti-ship missiles and more potent air defense weapons.

Russian hard-liners warn that Moscow can’t win if it doesn’t conduct a large mobilization and concentrate all of its resources in a decisive attack.

Igor Strelkov, a former security officer who led the separatists in 2014, denounced what he described as the Kremlin’s indecision, saying it could lead to defeat.

“For Russia, the strategic deadlock is deepening,” he said.

Ukrainian authorities are increasingly emboldened by the slow pace of the Russian offensive and growing Western support. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reaffirmed last week that pushing the Russians back to pre-invasion positions would represent a victory, but some aides declared even more ambitious goals.

Adviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine isn’t interested in a cease-fire “until Russia is ready to fully liberate occupied territories,” a bold statement that appears to reflect hopes for reclaiming the Donbas and Crimea.

Russia, meanwhile, apparently aims to bleed Ukraine by methodically striking fuel supplies and infrastructure while grinding out military gains. The Kremlin may also hope the West’s attention will shift elsewhere.

“Their final hope is that we will lose interest completely in the conflict in Ukraine by the summer,” Crump said. “They’re calculating the Western audiences will lose interest in the same way as Afghanistan last year. Russia thinks that time is working in its favor.”

How One Crack in the Line Opened a Path for the Russians,Marc Santora,https://www.nytimes.com/2024/05/14/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-battlefield.html,"May 14, 2024","The thunder of ferocious clashes unfolded at the nearby front line as the Ukrainian crew prepared to maneuver its American-made Bradley fighting vehicle out of camouflage and into the fire.

The commander of the team, a sergeant with the call sign Lawyer, nervously scanned the sky. “If we are seen, the KABs will come,” he said, referring to the one-ton bombs Russia has been using to target Ukraine’s most valuable armor and defenses.

What had started as a small Russian thrust into the tiny town of Ocheretyne was growing into a substantial breakthrough, threatening to unhinge the Ukrainian lines across a broad stretch of the eastern front. The crew’s mission was to help contain the breach: protect outmanned and outgunned infantry soldiers, evacuate the wounded and use the Bradley’s powerful 25-millimeter cannon against as many Russians as possible.

But the 28-ton vehicle was soon spotted. Mortars and rockets exploded all around, and the gunner was badly injured, said the commander, identified only by his call sign according to military protocol.

A combat assignment had turned into a mission to rescue his comrade. The gunner survived and is now recovering, Lawyer said a few days later as he recounted the attack. But the Russians gained territory and are continuing to try to press forward.

Ukraine is more vulnerable than at any time since the first harrowing weeks of the 2022 invasion, Ukrainian soldiers and commanders from a range of brigades interviewed in recent weeks said. Russia is trying to exploit this window of opportunity, stepping up its assaults across the east and now threatening to open a new front by attacking Ukrainian positions along the northern border outside the city of Kharkiv.

Months of delays in American assistance, a spiraling number of casualties and severe shortages of ammunition have taken a deep toll, evident in the exhausted expressions and weary voices of soldiers engaged in daily combat.

“Frankly speaking, I have fears,” said Lt. Col. Oleksandr Voloshyn, 57, the veteran tank battalion commander of the 59th Motorized Brigade. “Because if I will not have shells, if I will not have men, if I will not have equipment that my men can fight with…,” he said, trailing off. “That’s it.”

The sudden Russian advance through Ocheretyne, about nine miles northwest of Avdiivka, in late April, illustrates how even a small crack in the line can have cascading effects, as already-stretched platoons risk being flanked and encircled and other units race in to plug the breach.

“It’s like if you have an engine knock in your car, and you keep driving it,” Lt. Oleksandr Shyrshyn, 29, the deputy battalion commander for the 47th Mechanized Brigade, said. “The car works, but at some point, it will just stop. Then you’ll end up spending even more resources to restore it.”

“Similarly here, there are mistakes that do not seem critical,” he said. “But they’ve led to the need to stabilize the situation now. And it’s uncertain where that stabilization will occur.”

“Every event you did not predict can turn your situation completely upside down,” Lieutenant Shyrshyn said. “And this is what happened in Ocheretyne.”

The Ripple Effect
After the fall of Avdiivka to Russian forces in February, the small town of Ochertyne served as a Ukrainian military strong point along a highway. Most of the 3,000 residents had fled. Abandoned high-rise apartment blocks and other urban infrastructure provided good defensive positions and for two months, the situation remained relatively stable.

But then something went wrong.

The Russians appeared so suddenly on the battered streets around Ivan Vivsianyk’s home in late April that, at first glance, he mistook them for Ukrainian soldiers. When they asked him for his passport, the 88-year old knew the defense of Ocheretyne had collapsed.

“I thought that our soldiers would come and knock them out,” he said in an interview after making what he called a harrowing walk across the front line to escape. “But it didn’t happen.”

Three weeks later, what started as a small Russian advance has grown into a roughly 15-square-mile bulge that is complicating the defense of the Donetsk region.

Extending the bulge farther north could allow the Russians a chance to bypass some of the strongest Ukrainian fortifications in the east that have held for years. Russia can now also take a new line of attack aimed at Konstiantynivka, a town that is a logistical linchpin for Ukrainian forces.

The Kremlin’s bid to advance from one ruined village to the next has been captured in hours of combat footage shared by Ukrainian brigades at the front.

Russian infantry storm across mine-strewn fields on foot and use dirt bikes and dune buggies to try and outrace Ukrainian exploding drones. They attack in armored columns of varying sizes, with large assaults often led by tanks covered with massive metal sheds and equipped with sophisticated electronic warfare equipment to protect against drones. Western observers have dubbed them “turtle tanks.” The Ukrainians call them “wundervaflia,” which combines the German word for wonder with the Ukrainian word for waffle.

“We allow their infantry closer to us, which creates closer contact and direct firefights,” Lieutenant Shyrshyn said. “Therefore, our losses are increasing.”

The Russians are also paying a staggering price for every step forward. Some 899 Russian soldiers per day were killed or wounded in April, Britain’s military intelligence agency reported recently.

Despite throwing so many soldiers into the fight, the Russians took an area covering only about 30 square miles in April, according to military analysts. And capturing Ukraine’s last fortress cities in the Donbas  urban centers like Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk  would almost certainly involve long and bloody battles.

Still, the Russian advances in recent weeks in the east and northeast are starting to alter the geometry of the front in dangerous ways.

The Fraying Line
“Look at the map, where we are and where Ocheretyne is,” said Colonel Voloshyn, the tank battalion commander. He studied the terrain as he prepared to head out on a mission to target a house where 20 Russians were thought to be hiding. “I can now assume that they can simply bypass us on the left, on the right. They have tactical success, they have equipment, men, shells. So we can expect everything.”

The lack of dramatic shifts in the front for more than a year obscured the exhausting positional fighting needed to maintain that precarious balance. In a war where a battle over a single tree line can rage for weeks, the sudden Russian thrust into the area around Ocherytne was the most dangerous kind of problem  fast, deep and surprising.

There is a bitter debate over who was responsible for the failure to hold the line there.

The Deep State Telegram channel, which has close links to the Ukrainian army, accused the 115th Mechanized Brigade of leaving critical positions without orders, allowing the Russians to infiltrate and storm the settlement.

The brigade issued a furious denial, saying its soldiers were outnumbered by as much as 15 to one and held on as long as possible under withering bombardment.

“We want to emphasize that no regular unit of the 115th Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine left or fled positions,” the brigade said. A special military commission has been established to determine what precisely what happened.

Soldiers familiar with the fight were hesitant to publicly criticize a neighboring brigade and said a host of issues  from poor communication to being vastly outgunned  all likely played a role.

Lieutenant Shyrshyn of the 47th, which held positions next to the 115th, would not speculate on what went wrong, but said the consequences were immediate: It was soon clear that the 47th would have to fall back or risk encirclement and catastrophic losses.

“The Russians sensed the weakness in that direction as they used the gaps to get in behind the Ukrainian soldiers,” he said. “Then we lost Ocheretyne, then Novobakhmutivka, then Soloviove.”

The Ukrainian high command does not like to surrender any territory, the lieutenant said, adding that “it is very complicated to argue with them and explain why it is not good to hold this position.”

Lieutenant Shyrshyn hoped the situation would improve with the arrival of Western weapons but until then, he said, “we will continue to die, we will continue to lose territories”

“The question is whether it will be at a slow pace and defensible,” he said. “Or at a fast one and senseless.”",russia-ukraine-invasion,nytimes.txt
Australia urged to do more on climate crisis as activists rue trillion-dollar Cop29 funding gap,Adam Morton in Baku,https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2024/nov/25/australia-urged-to-do-more-on-climate-crisis-after-playing-role-in-trillion-dollar-cop29-shortfall,Sun 24 Nov 2024 18.59 EST,"The Australian government has been urged to “step up” and do more to address the climate crisis after a major UN summit ended with a global finance agreement that developing countries criticised for not going far enough.

The Cop29 talks in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku ended at 4am on Sunday with a consensus agreement that developing countries would be paid at least US$300bn (A$460bn) a year in global climate finance by 2035 to help them shift to a low-carbon economy and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather.

Wealthy nations, including Australia, agreed to “take the lead” in getting there. But they acknowledged developing countries actually needed at least US$1.3tn (A$2tn) a year.

The countries agreed to work together to find a way to achieve the higher target. It could include funding from private investors and potential new taxes on, for example, shipping and aviation.

The $1.3tn was based on a calculation by leading economists but many activists demanded more – as much as US$7tn a year – based on wealthy nations’ historic responsibility for rising damage caused by global heating.

The agreement cleared a final plenary session 34 hours after the scheduled close of the summit but some developing countries responded with fury, calling it not just a failure but a betrayal.

It may not have been accepted had the Azeri Cop29 president, Mukhtar Babayev, not gavelled it through before India could express its objection. India’s delegate, Chandni Raina, said the deal was an “optical illusion” and suggested the country would have blocked it given the chance.

Australia’s climate change minister, Chris Bowen, was a co-facilitator leading negotiations with nearly 200 countries on the design before making recommendations to the Azeri hosts. Bowen left before the final plenary on a pre-booked flight to return to Australia for parliament on Monday. Australia was represented by diplomats in the final stages.

Erin Ryan, a senior international campaigner at Climate Action Network Australia, said Cop29 had “ended as it ran”, held hostage by the interest of high-income countries and a petrostate host.

She said an annual goal of US$300bn might sound big “but when spread globally for what is required to transition, it leaves us where we started: with low-income countries struggling to shoulder the rising costs of a climate crisis they never caused”.

She added: “As a wealthy nation, and a huge fossil fuel exporter, the Australian government notably failed to drive bigger ambition. This is about realism. Getting better financial arrangements is key to getting global support for rapid fossil-fuel phase-out globally.”

The deal does not commit the Australia government to paying a particular amount. It has been sharply criticised for what Climate Action Tracker called “insufficient” climate finance commitments to date – A$3bn between 2020 and 2025. It was praised for committing A$50m to a loss and damage fund during the summit.

Greenpeace Australia Pacific’s head of advocacy, Susie Byers, said given that Australia was bidding to host a UN climate summit in 2026 with Pacific countries it had both “a responsibility and a strong interest in stepping up”. That meant the government presenting a climate plan early next year that would play the country’s part in aiming to limit global heating, she said.

“Australia must also honour the spirit of [last year’s] commitment to transition away from fossil fuels and replace its exports of coal and gas with renewable energy,” she said.

Richie Merzian, the chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group and a former climate diplomat, said a more ambitious finance deal was warranted but the end result was a “practical outcome” and Bowen deserved credit for his role.

“Now we need to get on with action to build the renewables, implement the transition and turn our complete attention to developing 2035 emission reduction targets due next year,” he said.

The Australian government had hoped to win the rights to host Cop31 in November 2026 during the Baku summit, but a decision under the UN’s consensus process was deferred after the other contender, Turkey, resisted pressure to step aside.

The agreement in Baku sets a deadline for the decision of June 2025, when climate diplomats meet in Bonn, Germany, but it could drag on until Cop30 in Brazil next November.

In a post on Bluesky reflecting on Cop29, Bowen posted a picture of himself talking with the UN secretary-general, António Guterres. He said “tackling climate change is in our national interest and getting climate finance right is vital for our nearest neighbours in the Pacific”.

“This Cop wasn’t easy, but it was important,” he said. “We also welcome the very strong ongoing support for Australia to host Cop31.”",cop29,guardian.txt
COP 29 Recap: From Financial Breakthroughs to Missed Opportunities,Patricia da Matta,https://nature4climate.org/cop-29-recap/,26.11.24,"The ‘finance’ COP, held in Baku over the past two weeks, has finally drawn to a close – albeit 33 hours (or is it decades?) too late. Tasked with addressing one of the most pressing questions for climate action – how to finance global mitigation and adaptation efforts – the 29th edition of the UN Climate Change Conference, COP29, concluded with an agreement that marks progress, but which fell short of what many were calling for, leaving us with mixed reactions to the ultimate COP outcome.

Zooming into nature-specific outcomes at COP, there is little to report, but this was never billed as a big COP for nature. All eyes are on Brazil in that regard. That’s not to say that the past two weeks were all bad news for nature.

**The new finance deal**

Under the framework established by the UN in 1992, 23 developed countries and the European Union, historically responsible for the majority of emissions, are obligated to contribute to climate finance. However, agreeing on the amount and establishing a fair framework for payments has proven far more complex. In this context, the COP29 climate summit in Baku marks a significant breakthrough: for the first time in 15 years, the UNFCCC Parties have set a long-term financial target to mobilise $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 across, – which would include funding from all public and private sources. A target of $300 billion annually has been established to “prime the pump” to support vulnerable nations in building resilience, expanding energy access, and fostering sustainable development – though no specific mentions of sectorial action can be found in the final text, nor are there any specific references to nature. Developed nations are expected to lead these efforts, with developing countries encouraged to contribute voluntarily.

The $300 billion target, described as a “floor, not a ceiling,” serves as a foundation for further financial commitments. The plan aims to redirect global financial systems toward climate action, ensuring investments prioritise the needs of vulnerable nations. Billions in direct financial support are projected to flow to developing countries by 2035, fostering resilience, expanding energy access, and enabling sustainable development. To guide these efforts, the “Baku to Belém Roadmap to 1.3T,” led by the COP Presidencies, will coordinate and drive progress toward this goal.

Despite the progress, the agreement comes with significant compromises. Crucially, the funds will be mobilized from a mix of public and private sources rather than guaranteed grants. Delegates from the poorest nations criticized wealthier countries for their slow and insufficient response, with some labelling the deal as “too little, too late.”

**Global UN Carbon Markets – A Decade in the Making**

Another major breakthrough at  COP29 was the finalization of rules for global carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. After nearly a decade of negotiations, countries agreed on two mechanisms:

- **Article 6.2:** Regulates bilateral carbon trading between countries.
- **Article 6.4:** Establishes a global crediting mechanism for emissions reductions.

These markets could unlock significant funding for climate action while enabling countries to meet their emissions targets more efficiently, and so this has rightly been described by many as a major milestone. 

Although the work is far from over. For Article 6.4, there is still critical attention required to the standards to ensure they don’t sideline natural climate solutions and Indigenous Peoples, including very impractical language around removals. For Article 6.2, it was agreed that the UN will not oversee the quality of environmental outcomes, nor will errors or inconsistencies receive any sort of penalty. While the agreement includes provisions for transparency to help ensure environmental integrity, there is still a risk that low-integrity deals can be struck, so civil society and media scrutiny will be more important than ever.

**The G20**

Across the globe, leaders from the 20 largest economies of the world issued a Leaders Declaration reaffirming the goals of the Paris Agreement, reiterating the outcome of the Global Stocktake in Dubai, referencing the G20’s Principles for the Bioeconomy and support for the Tropical Forest Forever Facility. Data launched by Nature4Climate reveals that G20 countries could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3370 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (MtCO2e) – comparable to India’s total emissions in 2023 – by prioritising nature in their climate strategy plans.

**National Contributions to the Rescue?**

However, current pledges still chart a path toward 2.7°C of warming—far beyond the 1.5°C goal outlined in the Paris Agreement. Nature-based solutions (NbS), which can provide a third of cost-effective mitigation, remain underutilized. Forests dominate existing NbS plans (92%), while ecosystems like mangroves (46%), wetlands (45%), and peatlands (just 4%) are largely overlooked.

To guide countries in developing comprehensive and investable NDCs, Nature4Climate launched a detailed framework during COP29. Expanding the scope of NbS in NDCs will be critical to closing the ambition gap.

**Speaking of nature…**

Not even crickets made it into the negotiation rooms – or so it seemed. Nature is a critical, yet vastly underfunded, climate solution. At the finance COP though, nature was sadly overlooked. During the tense NCQG talks, more than 100 organizations urged Parties to include ambitious commitments to finance nature within the new climate goal text. However, in the final stages, all mentions of ecosystems, nature and biodiversity were removed.

The omission underscores a glaring $700 billion annual funding gap for nature finance. Scaling up investments in nature-based solutions, such as restoring degraded forests or protecting wetlands, could generate up to 20 million jobs by 2030 while safeguarding the natural systems that underpin economies. Yet only 33% of nature-related policies published since the Paris Agreement have allocated budgets.

To meet climate goals, financial flows to NbS must almost triple by 2030. COP30 offers a chance to correct this oversight, but action must start now.

**Political momentum for forests**

Forests, however, did have a minute or so under the spotlight. The Forest and Climate Leaders’ Partnership (FCLP) highlighted progress on six country packages and reported that, over the first three years of the Global Forest Finance Pledge, the 11 participating governments and the European Union have collectively contributed USD 10 billion towards the USD 12 billion initially committed for forest conservation and restoration activities. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden took his first trip to the Amazon to launch the new Brazil Restoration and Bioeconomy Finance Coalition (BRB Finance Coalition) to accelerate the conservation and restoration of Brazil’s forests, with a targeted, aggregate investment of at least $10 billion by 2030 among all coalition members.

Though these indeed pose positive signs, the crucial ecosystem was notably absent from the decision texts.

**The Road to Belém**

As 2024 is confirmed to be the hottest year on record, the urgency for transformative action has never been greater. COP29 made progress but left critical issues unresolved. The failure to agree on outcomes from last year’s global stocktake, including a timeline for phasing out fossil fuels, has left the COP30 Presidency with (what feels like) too many checkboxes to tick off.

As COP29 concludes, Alice de Moraes Amorim Vogas, Head of COP30 Brazil, shares an inspiring vision for COP30 in Belém. Brazil aims to consolidate its leadership in the global climate agenda, showcasing its commitment to transitioning to a low-carbon, inclusive future.

Brazil’s President Lula has called for a “fair, fast, and funded” transition to sustainable energy systems and forest protection.

One good thing to look forward to (aside from the food) is the promise of the largest Indigenous delegation ever seen, as announced by Minister Sonia Guajajara.

“The Paris Agreement process is still alive, albeit barely. Hopefully, the ambition evident in fresh NDCs from Brazil and others, coupled with President Lula’s recent G20 Summit comments, will inject fresh vigor into UN climate talks at COP30 – but the international community would be wise to expect more bumps on the road between Baku and Belém.”

2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference,Wikipedia contributors,https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference,11–22 November 2024,"The 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference or Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, more commonly known as COP29, was the 29th United Nations Climate Change conference. Held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November 2024.[1] Mukhtar Babayev presided, while Samir Nuriyev headed the Organising Committee.[2][3]

The conference concluded with an agreement on plans for finance to mitigate the effects of climate change and help developing nations transition to more sustainable energy sources.[4] Rules and a UN registry were agreed to facilitate and record international trading of carbon credits.[5]

The choice of Azerbaijan as the location for the conference was controversial because it is a major oil and gas producer and authoritarian state with extensive corruption,[6][7][8] with several ""official partners"" of COP29 being businesses directly owned by President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, or tied to the Aliyev family's businesses.[6][7]

**Critique of choice of location**

Cop29 in Azerbaijan

In December 2023, Azerbaijan was announced as the host of the conference. Held on a rotating schedule, the annual COP summit was set to be hosted by an Eastern European nation. However, Reuters reported that, during the previous COP28 meeting in Dubai, Eastern European countries had agreed to back Azerbaijan's bid for the 2024 edition.[12]

Critics argued that hosting COP29 in Azerbaijan was inappropriate due to the country's poor human rights record and an alleged ethnic cleansing against the Armenian population in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.[13][14] They also highlighted that Azerbaijan was a major fossil fuel producer, with an authoritarian government extensively linked to corruption,[6][15] and saw the choice to assign hosting rights for the COP29 to the country as a way to greenwash its reputation.[16][17]

Additionally, concerns were raised about the government's repression of journalists and environmental activists before the conference, indicating a suppression of free speech and civil society.[18][19][20] Michael Rubin, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote that COP29 risked legitimizing Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev's authoritarian government, comparing the occurrence to the political exploitation of the 1936 Summer Olympics by Adolf Hitler's regime.[21] Reporters and anti-corruption non-profits also criticized extensive corruption occurring in the country, with ""official partners"" of COP29 being businesses that were either owned directly by or tied to the Aliyev family.[6][22]

Amnesty International said the Host Country Agreement (HCA) between Azerbaijan and the UNFCCC should include arrangements that guaranteed that ""all human rights [were] protected and respected"", and must be made public immediately, citing Azerbaijan's human rights violations. The rights group drew a comparison with the situation during COP28, which had been hosted by the United Arab Emirates, stating that it had made multiple efforts to obtain the HCA signed in August 2023. Amnesty received a copy of COP28's HCA in June 2024, and revealed that it had ""significant shortcomings and ambiguities"" in rights protections offered to the participants in Dubai.[23]

On 11 November 2024, climate activist Greta Thunberg attended a rally in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, to protest Azerbaijan's hosting of the COP29. Thunberg and other activists criticized Azerbaijan's repressive government, and use of the summit to ""greenwash"" human rights abuses. She called it ""absurd"" to hold climate talks in an ""authoritarian petrostate"" amid rising emissions and a climate crisis.[24]

Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev described the criticism as a ""smear campaign"" and said it ""[could not] derail us from achieving our noble mission to cope with the negative impacts of climate change.""[8]

**Pre-COP29 negotiations**

At the Climate Change Conference in Bonn in June 2024, despite positive outcomes on the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) and adaptation indicators for COP29,[25] limited progress was achieved on the effective implementation of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, with unresolved issues surrounding carbon credit systems and emission avoidance.[26] In the occasion, United Nations Climate Change Executive Secretary, Simon Stiell, stressed the need for further work to address those issues before COP29.[27]

In July 2024, Azerbaijan announced the institution of the Climate Finance Action Fund (CFAF), a fund that aimed to seek US$1 billion in annual contributions from fossil fuel-producing countries and companies, which would then be re-invested in renewable energy and support of climate projects in developing countries; half of the resources from the CFAF would reportedly be allocated to national plans for the fulfillment of the targets set by the Paris Agreement. 20% of the total revenues would be allocated to a Rapid Response Funding Facility (2R2F) for disaster support.[28][29] 

On 10 and 11 October, Azerbaijan hosted the annual Pre-COP meeting to initiate discussions ahead of COP29. The conference, centered around the motto ""Strengthening Ambitions and Ensuring Action"", opened with COP29 President-designate Mukhtar Babayev, COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, and UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed.[30] Guests discussed priorities such as the need for a new climate finance goal to replace the former $100 billion target, the full activation of the Loss and Damage Fund —originally established during the COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh—, and wider support of vulnerable communities. Discussions also included updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) from countries and the finalization of guidelines for carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Leaders emphasized the need to cap global warming at 1.5°C, as data from the UN Environment Programme had suggested that existing climate pledges may allow for an overall 2.9°C increase.[31][32] 

**Conference agenda**

COP29 aimed to implement further measures to limit global warming to 1.5°C, emphasizing the urgent need for investment in climate action.[38][39] The COP29 Presidency stressed the importance of operationalizing the Loss and Damage Fund to support vulnerable communities, particularly in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), while calling for enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in line with 1.5°C targets and urging the submission of national NDCs by 2025, with a focus on fossil fuel phase-out, increasing renewable energy, and addressing non-carbon-dioxide emissions, such as methane. On adaptation, the Presidency called for all countries to prepare and submit their National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) by 2025 and emphasized the need for scaling up adaptation finance. In addition, COP29 encouraged global financial institutions and the private sector to increase climate finance and foster investment in green innovation. The summit aimed to provide platforms to mobilize business participation and enhance transparency in investment decisions to support climate action.[40] 

**Climate finance**

At COP29, climate finance was considered to be a central topic, focusing on scaling up resources for developing countries to address climate impacts and transition to low-carbon economies. A key agenda item was the negotiation of the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance, which would set a new financial target to support developing countries after 2025, building on the previous $100 billion annual commitment.[45][46] Proposed solutions included blended finance, which combined public and private investments to amplify funding for climate initiatives, and debt-for-nature swaps, which would allow countries to re-allocate debt repayments toward environmental and climate projects.[46]

Among the major developments, multilateral development banks, including the World Bank and European Investment Bank, pledged to increase climate-related lending to $120 billion annually for low- and middle-income countries, while the Asian Development Bank announced $7.2 billion in additional investments and a $3.5 billion adaptation program targeting glacial melting in Central Asia and the Southern Caucasus. Non-profit investor Acumen pledged $300 million for agricultural adaptation in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, while the Climate Investment Funds launched a $75 billion bond issuance program on the London Stock Exchange. The Association of Banks of Azerbaijan also committed nearly $1.2 billion to support the country's low-carbon transition.[47]

At the conference, world leaders ratified a key framework under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement, establishing a UN-backed body to regulate international carbon credit trading. The decision is expected to unlock billions of dollars in climate finance, mainly destined to developing countries.[48]

Delegations also reached an agreement for a deal that would oblige developed nations to make a $300 billion annual climate finance pledge by 2035, in order to help developing countries get access to wider economic resources to tackle emissions and climate disasters. However, poorer nations criticized the amount as insufficient, with many pushing for a minimum $500 billion target. While the deal was seen as a small step, critics, including UN officials, called it a betrayal, especially due to the lack of mandatory contributions for emerging economies like China.[49]

Key points of tension in the negotiations were the donor base, in which developed economies such as the US and the European Union had insisted that more countries with resources like China and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries should have contributed by default, and the share of funding coming from public budgets, where developing countries had insisted on significant increases in public, non-loan grants.[50] The final $300 billion text stated that climate funding will come from both public and private sources, and encouraged voluntary contributions from developing countries, including China and Middle Eastern countries.[51]

**Energy transition**

Following COP28 in Dubai, COP29 will focus on advancing the energy transition agenda, with particular emphasis on reducing global reliance on fossil fuels and scaling up renewable energy deployment. Key goals include establishing specific timelines for phasing out coal and developing green hydrogen markets, both of which are critical to achieving the Paris Agreement targets. COP29 will also address energy security concerns, especially for economies heavily dependent on fossil fuels, and will support policies that ensure a just and equitable transition for affected communities.[52]

To facilitate these shifts, COP29 is expected to promote collaborative frameworks that enable countries to share technology, expertise, and resources. This includes regional integration of renewable energy grids, which can improve energy access while reducing emissions. By advancing these initiatives, COP29 seeks to create sustainable, resilient energy systems that align with long-term climate goals.[46]

**Controversies**

COP29 Chief Executive, Elnur Soltanov, was secretly recorded discussing potential oil and gas deals during the conference, raising serious concerns about a breach of COP ethics. Critics argued that Soltanov's behavior undermined the conference's goal of transitioning away from fossil fuels, as Soltanov also held a key role in Azerbaijan's energy sector.[53]

EU diplomats criticized Azerbaijan for not putting fossil fuel phase-out on the agenda of the conference, which solely mentioned mitigation.[54] On 31 October 2024, Papua New Guinea's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Justin Tkatchenko, announced that the country would boycott the summit entirely, calling it a ""total waste of time"".[55] 

In October 2024, Human Rights Watch revealed the HCA between the UN and Azerbaijan, which had been signed in August.[56] Although the COP29 HCA was made public prior to the climate conference, unlike COP28, it was described as ""disappointing, but not surprising."" HRW said the HCA was full of ""significant shortcomings and ambiguities on the protections for participants' rights"". The agreement was released alongside HRW's report exposing the efforts of Azerbaijan's government to ""silence its critics"", where several activists and journalists were arrested on baseless and serious criminal charges.[57][58][59]

On 14 November 2024, the UN was forced to respond to complaints about the lack of vegan, vegetarian and plant-based food options at the COP29. Reportedly only a single food stall in the event's food court sold vegan options, whereas the majority of food stalls, including a Domino's Pizza, sold meat-based meals. In response to the controversy, vegan campaigners handed out free sandwiches.[60]

On 15 November 2024, the Kick Big Polluters Out (KBPO) coalition, which included Global Witness, Corporate Accountability, and Corporate Europe Observatory, reported that at least 1,773 fossil fuel lobbyists were granted access to the COP29 climate summit in Baku, surpassing the size of nearly each national delegation, except for Azerbaijan (2,229), Brazil (1,914), and Turkey (1,862). According to the KBPO, the report highlighted the ""disproportionate presence"" of industry representatives in comparison to delegates from the ten most climate-vulnerable nations, which had collectively sent 1,033 participants.[61][62][63]

On 23 November 2024, The Guardian revealed that a Saudi Arabian delegate had allegedly tried to modify an official negotiating text, a type of document that was usually circulated as non-editable PDF by COP presidencies to all countries simultaneously.[64]

The campaign website cop29.com was purchased by Global Witness instead of Azerbaijan's COP29 team and became a focal point of controversy. Backed by notable figures such as actor Jude Law and former UN climate chief Mary Robinson, the site advocated for fossil fuel companies to fund climate damages, highlighting their $4 trillion earnings in 2022 compared to the $702 million pledged at the summit. The website was banned at the summit venue, and, according to the Financial Times, Azerbaijan blocked domestic access to the site in what was described as a ""fossil fuel domain name war,"" intensifying debates over the influence of fossil fuel interests in the COP process.[65]

Frank Pallone recounted an alarming encounter during his visit to the UN-led climate conference in Baku. He was confronted by hostile, coordinated questions from local media, which he believed were orchestrated by the Azerbaijani government to intimidate him. He accused the Azerbaijani government of repressing free speech and using the event to deflect criticism of its human rights record. Ed Markey also faced harassment, calling out Azerbaijan for ""greenwashing"" its climate and human rights record. Both lawmakers criticized the country’s treatment of political prisoners and its stance on negotiations with Armenia.[66]",cop29,wikipedia.txt
What happened at COP29 in week one? A summary for investors,Callum Provan,https://www.iigcc.org/insights/what-happened-cop29-in-week-one-summary-investors,19.11.24,"The Finance and Energy/Peace, Relief and Recovery Days saw a flurry of activity from investors and other non-state actors in Baku, even as uncertainty remained around the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance which must be agreed at COP29.

Some 65,000 attendees welcomed an official day of rest on 17 November after a packed first week. Rumours in Baku Stadium centred on the progress of the COP29 Finance text, which Carbon Brief reported has reduced from 33 to 25 pages. Many brackets, however, signal slow progress in overcoming disagreements and a challenging week ahead for negotiators.

Several world leaders did not attend, including US President Biden, French President Macron, and the EU’s Ursula von der Leyen, though other countries did announce new climate plans. The UK, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates shared updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) at the conference, setting a standard for other nations to follow.

“This statement of intent signals UK leadership on climate and offers a valuable opportunity to attract clean energy investments, spur clean growth, and strengthen investor confidence in the country’s climate trajectory.”

The UK plans to cut 81% of greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, relative to 1990 levels, while Brazil pledged to cut emissions 59-67% by the same year, relative to 2005. The United Arab Emirates, host to last year’s COP28, announced its plan to reduce 47% of its emissions by 2035, relative to a notably higher baseline of 2019.

Reacting to the UK announcement, Stephanie Pfeifer, CEO of IIGCC said:

“This statement of intent signals UK leadership on climate and offers a valuable opportunity to attract clean energy investments, spur clean growth, and strengthen investor confidence in the country’s climate trajectory.”

An unavoidable investment case

In the ‘real economy COP’, our delegation was on the ground to discuss how best to increase investment in emerging markets, the need for more investable NDCs including National Adaptation Plans, and the challenges of decarbonising the built environment.

This included co-hosting an event with the Atlantic Council, which convened financial institutions and climate finance negotiators in an informal discussion, sharing mutual needs to inform the negotiations. Moderated by Valentina Ramirez, IIGCC Head of Climate Strategy Implementation, investors emphasised the need for industrial policies that incentivise investments in climate solutions, encouraging negotiators to complement their approach to the NCQG to foster stronger engagement with private finance actors.

""“I can tell you how to talk to the trees, talk to the water. You can connect with Indigenous communities…Businesses have to invest in people.”

On day two, we co-hosted a panel with the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action to strengthen impactful collaboration between public and private actors to deliver climate finance at scale, particularly in developing countries. The event was convened by the COP29 Presidency with an opening keynote from Nigar Arpadarai, the Azerbaijani Climate Change High-level Champion.

Arianna Griffa, IIGCC Senior Policy Manager, moderated a panel with Rowan Douglas, CEO of Climate Risk and Resilience at Howden; Raquel Moses, CEO of the Caribbean Climate Smart Accelerator; and Juan Carlos Jintiach, Executive Secretary of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities.

Juan Carlos, a member of the Shuar Indigenous group in the Amazon Rainforest of Ecuador who was shortlisted for the Nobel Peace Prize, explained to the audience:

“I can tell you how to talk to the trees, talk to the water. You can connect with Indigenous communities…Businesses have to invest in people.”

Attracting investment

On Friday, we co-hosted an official side event as a founding partner of the Investor Agenda, featuring discussions with IIGCC members, other international investors and government officials. The event began with a reminder that 650 investors, representing more than USD33 trillion in assets under management, signed their support for the 2024 Global Investor Statement on the Climate Crisis.

Matias Cardomingo, General Coordinator for Social and Environmental Impact Analysis for the Ministry of Finance in Brazil, delivered the opening remarks. He outlined the country’s new climate and ecological transformation investment platform, named BIP, which, alongside a suite of supportive green policies, can help to attract investments for the transition.

This was followed by a panel discussion on policy action to unlock investments for a net zero and resilient economy, moderated by Arianna Griffa.

The panel featured insights from Erich Cripton, Director of Business Relations at the Caisse de Dépôt et Placement du Québec (CDPQ); Natalie Sinha, Head of Sustainability, Infrastructure Investing at UBS; and Hidehiko Sogano, Director and Managing Executive Officer at Dai-ichi Life Holdings in Japan. Discussions reiterated the need for clear sectoral pathways to support hard-to-abate sectors, underscored by an appetite from private finance to do more.

We shared new climate solutions guidance for renewable energy infrastructure, which aims to support the COP28 target of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030.

A second panel explored how investor action is accelerating the transition to the net zero economy. It was moderated by Nicolette Bartlett, Chief Impact Officer at CDP with panellists Jan Kæraa Rasmussen, Head of ESG and Sustainability at PensionDanmark; Peter van der Werf, Head of Active Ownership and Executive Director at Robeco; and Nana Li, Head of Sustainability and Stewardship, Asia Pacific at Impax Investment Management.

Peter shared Robeco’s “traffic light system” to assess company and country sustainability maturity and referenced our paper, making NDCs investable, while Nana Li shared new research from Impax IM which supports investment in developing markets.

Taking action

Elsewhere, Valentina spoke on a panel focused on de-risking private climate finance, hosted by the Danish Industry, and a panel on the increasing role of pull finance to de-risk investments in emerging markets, hosted by KPMG in the Canada Pavilion.

Valentina also moderated a panel on driving innovative approaches to incentivise climate resilience investment, before joining a panel to discuss real economy standards to deliver an equitable net zero future, outlining lessons from the Net Zero Investment Framework.

Hugh Garnett, Senior Programme Manager, Real Assets, spoke in an official UNFCCC implementation lab focused on how best to enhance ambition for energy policy. He shared our new climate solutions guidance for renewable energy infrastructure, which aims to support the COP28 target of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030.

This came alongside a panel where Hugh discussed investing in innovative solutions to decarbonise the built environment, highlighting the challenge of measuring energy efficiency.

Overall, despite the uncertainty around headline negotiations across finance, mitigation and adaptation, one thing is clear: investors made their voices heard and are taking action. Now, all eyes are on the final week of negotiations.",cop29,iigcc.txt
COP29 Ends with Compromise on Climate Financing,Not Specified,https://wmo.int/media/news/cop29-ends-compromise-climate-financing,25 November 2024,"The UN climate change conference ended on 24 November with a pledge from developed nations to mobilize at least $300 billion annually to support mitigation and adaptation.

After two weeks of intense negotiations, delegates at COP29, formally the 29th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), agreed to provide this funding annually, with an overall climate financing target to reach “at least $1.3 trillion by 2035”.

This summit had been dubbed the ‘climate finance COP’, and representatives from all countries were seeking to establish a new, higher climate finance goal.

The target, or new collective quantified goal (NCQG), will replace the existing $100 billion goal that is due to expire in 2025.

Reacting to the outcome, UN Secretary-General António Guterres said that while an agreement at COP29 was absolutely essential to keep the 1.5-degree limit alive, “I had hoped for a more ambitious outcome – on both finance and mitigation – to meet the great challenge we face.”

But he continued, this agreement provides a base on which to build and added: It must be honoured in full and on time. Commitments must quickly become cash. All countries must come together to ensure the top-end of this new goal is met.""

Developing countries, which had sought over $1 trillion in assistance, said the pledge of financing was too little too late.

The WMO delegation at COP29, headed by Secretary-General Celeste Saulo, highlighted the urgency of drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions – and more financing to build resilience, and in particular to strengthen early warning systems.

According to WMO’s State of the Climate Update, the year 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record and temporarily hit 1.5°C. Greenhouse gas levels are at record observed levels. Sea level rise is accelerating, glacier retreat is unprecedented, and extreme weather events have caused major loss of life and livelihoods around the world.

“The time for action is now,” said Celeste Saulo. “If you want a safer planet, it’s our responsibility. It’s a common responsibility, a global responsibility,” she said.

The COP29 outcome is a gesture of support for the most vulnerable, said Celeste Saulo. But much more needs to be done.

Following on from COP29, WMO will prioritize accelerated action to strengthen global climate mitigation and adaptation, and reduce loss and damage. It will continue leveraging its State of the Climate reports to inform climate policy, finance, and action.

Key focus areas include scaling up the Early Warnings for All initiative to ensure comprehensive early warning coverage, and advancing Global Greenhouse Gas Watch to improve monitoring and mitigation.

Another priority is to close the gaps in Earth observations. These are necessary to inform both mitigation and adaptation, as was noted in the SBSTA Chair summary. WMO will take a similar approach to closing the gaps in Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems.

At COP29, additional contributions were announced to the United Nations Systematic Observations Financing Facility (SOFF) that is now capitalized with more than US $100 million to support countries in closing their basic weather and climate data gaps.

A consolidated WMO strategy to support countries in updating Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) to reflect these elements will be developed. A critical element will be positioning National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) as the authoritative voice of hydro-meteorological early warnings and central actors in driving science-based solutions, ensuring their enhanced role in implementing climate policies and strategies worldwide.

Young people will be a key focus. Consultations with youth organizations on climate action will help guide the development of WMO's Youth Action Plan.

Other steps forward at COP29 included:

Countries agreed on the rules for a UN-backed global carbon market. This market will facilitate the trading of carbon credits, incentivizing countries to reduce emissions and invest in climate-friendly projects.

They agreed to an extension of a programme centered on gender and climate change; and agreement on support for the least developed countries to carry out national adaptation plans.

UN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell described the new finance goal agreed at COP29 as “an insurance policy for humanity.”

“This deal will keep the clean energy boom growing and protect billions of lives. It will help all countries to share in the huge benefits of bold climate action: more jobs, stronger growth, cheaper and cleaner energy for all. But like any insurance policy – it only works – if the premiums are paid in full, and on time.”

He acknowledged that no country got everything they wanted, and that the world leaves Baku with a mountain of work to do. “So, this is no time for victory laps. We need to set our sights and redouble our efforts on the road to Belém,” in the eastern Amazonian region of Brazil, which is set to host COP30 next year.

COP 29 saw also the launch of the Baku Dialogue on Water for Climate Action, a platform that promotes collaboration and initiatives that accelerate solutions for the water crisis. WMO is one of the co-founding signatories and exercise its mandate to provide robust and science-based evidence.",cop29,wmo.txt
COP29: Key outcomes agreed at the UN climate talks in Baku,Multiple Authors,https://www.carbonbrief.org/cop29-key-outcomes-agreed-at-the-un-climate-talks-in-baku/,24.11.2024,"Developed nations have agreed to help channel “at least” $300bn a year into developing countries by 2035 to support their efforts to deal with climate change. However, the new climate-finance goal – agreed along with a range of other issues at the COP29 summit in Baku, Azerbaijan – has left developing countries bitterly disappointed. They were united in calling for developed countries to raise $1.3tn a year in climate finance. 

In the end, negotiators agreed on a looser call to raise $1.3tn each year from a wide range of sources, including private investment, by 2035. 

Some countries, including India and Nigeria, accused the COP29 presidency of pushing the deal through without their proper consent, following chaotic last-minute negotiations. Countries failed to reach an agreement on how the outcomes of last year’s “global stocktake”, including a key pledge to transition away from fossil fuels, should be taken forward – instead shunting the decision to COP30 next year in Brazil. They did manage to find agreement on the remaining sections of Article 6 on carbon markets, meaning all elements of the Paris Agreement have been finalised nearly 10 years after it was signed. 

Negotiations were overshadowed by the reelection of Donald Trump, who has promised to roll back climate action and take the world’s biggest historical emitter out of the Paris Agreement once again. COP president Azerbaijan – a country that sources two-thirds of its government revenue from fossil fuels – faced accusations of conflict of interest and malpractice, with one minister labelling its hosting style “deplorable”.
