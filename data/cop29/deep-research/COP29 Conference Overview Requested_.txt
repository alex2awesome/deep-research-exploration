COP29 in Baku: Navigating Finance, Finalizing Rules, and Confronting a Widening Climate Action Gap

I. Executive Summary

The 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP29), held in Baku, Azerbaijan, concluded with a mixed legacy, marked by a pivotal agreement on a new global climate finance goal and the long-awaited operationalization of carbon market rules under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. However, these achievements were set against a backdrop of significant shortcomings, notably the failure to advance ambitious mitigation action concerning fossil fuels and a pervasive dissatisfaction among developing nations regarding the scale and terms of the financial commitments. The conference underscored the persistent and widening chasm between the escalating urgency of the climate crisis and the pace of collective political will. While the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance established a new floor, its perceived inadequacy by many recipient nations, coupled with contentious negotiation dynamics, further strained trust. The finalization of Article 6 rules offers a potential pathway for increased climate investment, yet its ultimate environmental integrity remains contingent on robust implementation. COP29 has thus set a complex stage for COP30 in Belém, Brazil, where the submission of enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) will be a critical test of global resolve to keep the 1.5°C temperature limit within reach. The overarching challenge emerging from Baku is the urgent need to translate incremental progress into the transformative action required to address the climate emergency.

II. Introduction to COP29: Setting the Stage in Baku

The 29th session of the Conference of the Parties (COP29) to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) convened in Baku, Azerbaijan, from November 11, 2024. Following intense negotiations, the conference officially concluded on November 24, 2024, two days beyond its scheduled end.1 The leadership of this critical summit was entrusted to H.E. Mukhtar Babayev, Azerbaijan's Minister of Ecology and Natural Resources, who was appointed COP29 President in January 2024.3 Mr. Babayev brought experience from leading Azerbaijan's delegation to five previous COPs and a background that includes a significant tenure at the State Oil Company of Azerbaijan (SOCAR), where he oversaw sustainability and environmental efforts.3

The conference unfolded against a backdrop of considerable geopolitical turbulence and mounting economic pressures worldwide, factors that inevitably shaped the negotiating positions and capacities of participating nations. Coming on the heels of COP28 and its first Global Stocktake – an assessment which starkly revealed the insufficiency of global progress towards achieving the Paris Agreement's objectives 4 – COP29 faced immense pressure. The primary expectation was the delivery of robust financial mechanisms and clear pathways to accelerate climate action across the board. This urgency was amplified by the alarming climatic context: the 12-month period from February 2023 to January 2024 had already registered as the first to exceed the 1.5°C global warming threshold as an average above pre-industrial levels, serving as a stark "clarion call" for significantly increased ambition and immediate action.5

The selection of Azerbaijan, a nation with significant oil and gas production, as the host for COP29 introduced an inherent paradox from the outset. This "petrostate presidency" drew considerable scrutiny and skepticism from many observers and participants regarding the host's intrinsic commitment to aggressively championing a global transition away from fossil fuels. Such concerns were not entirely unfounded; the President of Azerbaijan, Ilham Aliyev, was reported to have made statements describing oil and gas as a "gift from God".6 These remarks, coupled with the COP29 President's own historical ties to the state oil company 3, fueled anxieties. This situation was particularly notable when contrasted with COP28 in the UAE, another petrostate, which had managed to secure landmark language on "transitioning away from fossil fuels." The eventual outcome at COP29, where strong language on fossil fuel phase-out was notably absent and attempts to advance this agenda were effectively blocked 6, suggests that the host nation's economic priorities may have influenced the negotiation dynamics and ultimate textual compromises, creating a challenging environment for advancing a more aggressive fossil fuel agenda.

Furthermore, COP29 was explicitly designated as the "finance COP".2 This designation, born out of the critical need to establish a New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance to succeed the unmet $100 billion annual pledge from developed countries, placed an extraordinary weight of expectation on this single agenda item. While addressing the climate finance gap was undeniably crucial, this intense and singular focus may have inadvertently diverted political capital and negotiating bandwidth from other equally critical areas. Indeed, reports from the conference indicate that progress on issues such as enhancing mitigation ambition through the Mitigation Work Programme was comparatively muted, with some key commitments from COP28 even diluted in the final texts, arguably as a trade-off for securing any agreement on the contentious finance package.8 This highlights a recurring challenge in multilateral climate negotiations: the prioritization of one critical issue can sometimes lead to suboptimal outcomes in others.

III. Key Negotiated Outcomes and Agreements

COP29 yielded several significant, albeit contested, outcomes. The negotiations were dominated by the establishment of a new climate finance goal and the finalization of rules for international carbon markets.

The New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on Climate Finance:

The central achievement of COP29 was the agreement on the NCQG. Developed countries committed to mobilize "at least $300 billion" annually by 2035.2 This public finance commitment is part of a broader aspirational goal for "all actors" to collectively raise at least $1.3 trillion per year by 2035, drawing from both public and private sources, to support developing countries in their climate actions.9 This represents a tripling of the previous $100 billion annual floor that developed countries had pledged. To support the scaling up of finance towards this broader $1.3 trillion figure, the "Baku-Belem Roadmap to $1.3T" was launched, signaling an ongoing process of discussion and effort intended to culminate at COP30 in Belém, Brazil.11

Despite these figures, the NCQG was fraught with contentious elements. The $300 billion public finance target from developed nations fell significantly short of the demands articulated by developing countries, whose asks ranged from $440 billion to as high as $1.3 trillion annually from public sources alone.6 A new and debated aspect of the NCQG was the inclusion of language encouraging "voluntary contributions" from developing countries, a departure from previous finance goals.8 Significant ambiguity also persisted regarding the precise sources of finance that would count towards the goals, the methodologies for accounting, particularly for contributions from Multilateral Development Banks (MDBs), and the role and nature of private finance mobilization.8

While marking a quantitative increase from the previous target, the NCQG was widely criticized by developing nations and many observers as insufficient to meet the actual, and rapidly escalating, financial needs for mitigation, adaptation, and addressing loss and damage, which are estimated to be in the order of multiple trillions of dollars annually.6 The depth of dissatisfaction was starkly illustrated when the Alliance of Small Island States (AOSIS), a group of nations on the frontlines of climate impacts, walked out of the NCQG negotiations in protest.2

Breakthrough on Article 6: Finalizing Carbon Market Rules:

A significant breakthrough at COP29 was the finalization of the technical rules for international carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. This development, often referred to as the "Baku Breakthrough" 14, resolved years of deadlock and operationalized mechanisms for Article 6.2, which governs cooperative approaches and the bilateral transfer of Internationally Transferred Mitigation Outcomes (ITMOs), and Article 6.4, which establishes a new global UN-supervised carbon market known as the Paris Agreement Crediting Mechanism (PACM).6

Under Article 6.2, countries can bilaterally trade emission reductions. Article 6.4 creates the PACM, which will issue its own carbon credits (A6.4ERs), with the first credits anticipated to be available from early 2025.15 A crucial element of both mechanisms is the requirement for "corresponding adjustments" to avoid the double counting of emission reductions, ensuring that if one country claims a reduction, the selling country adjusts its own emissions ledger accordingly.15

The operationalization of Article 6 was hailed by many as a major achievement of COP29 9, intended to unlock significant private and public finance flows towards emission reduction projects, particularly in developing countries. However, the manner of its adoption was not without controversy. Some delegates and civil society groups criticized the process as overly hasty, with accusations of a "carbon coup" where the rules were pushed through without full deliberation.6 Furthermore, persistent concerns remain regarding the need for robust and transparent rules to ensure the environmental integrity of the credits generated and to prevent "greenwashing" or the creation of "hot air" credits that do not represent real and additional emission reductions.11 The true test of Article 6 will therefore lie in its rigorous implementation and the credibility of its oversight mechanisms. While the framework is now in place, its effectiveness in contributing to genuine global emission reductions, rather than merely facilitating creative accounting, is yet to be proven.

Progress on Adaptation Frameworks and the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA):

Negotiations on adaptation, a critical priority for developing countries, saw some incremental progress. Discussions advanced the work programme on national adaptation frameworks, with a notable focus on ensuring that finance is explicitly included as an indicator of progress in adaptation efforts.12 A "Baku Adaptation Roadmap" was also mentioned as an outcome, intended to guide future work.11 Parties provided further instructions for the ongoing technical work by experts on developing indicators to measure progress towards achieving global resilience under the Global Goal on Adaptation.11

However, more substantial breakthroughs on adaptation were hindered by several contentious issues. Disagreements persisted over the "means of implementation," primarily the provision of adequate and predictable finance for adaptation actions.8 The concept of "transformational adaptation" – referring to deep, systemic changes rather than incremental adjustments – was promoted by some developed countries but met with resistance from certain developing nations, who feared it could introduce new conditionalities or barriers to accessing finance.8 Ultimately, a review of the GGA framework itself was deferred until after the second global stocktake, scheduled for 2028.8 While adaptation remains high on the agenda, the outcomes from COP29 in this area were largely seen as procedural advancements rather than transformative commitments.

Operationalization of the Loss and Damage Fund (FRLD):

A symbolically important step was the formal operationalization of the Fund for Responding to Loss and Damage (FRLD), with commitments made for disbursements to begin in 2025.12 This was a key demand from vulnerable countries who are already experiencing severe and irreversible impacts of climate change.

However, a significant gap emerged between the pledges made to the fund and the estimated needs. Initial pledges totaled around $700-$731 million.12 This figure pales in comparison to annual needs assessments, with UNCTAD estimating $150 billion annually 12 and other analyses suggesting figures as high as $724 billion.13 A key point of contention was that the NCQG decision did not include loss and damage as a distinct sub-goal for financing, a specific request from many developing countries who feared that loss and damage funding might be subsumed under adaptation finance or otherwise neglected.13 Positively, the scope of the FRLD agreed at COP28, which includes "displacement, relocation and migration," was maintained.13 The operationalization is a milestone, but the fund's ability to deliver meaningful support will depend entirely on a dramatic scaling up of financial resources from a broader base of contributors.

Other Key Decisions:

Mitigation Work Programme (MWP): The MWP decision identified technical options for emission reductions, particularly in urban settings, and invited Parties and observers to propose topics for dialogues scheduled for 2025. A digital platform for exchanging information on mitigation actions is also to be designed.11 However, a significant point of criticism was the removal of all mentions of fossil fuels and references to key COP28 pledges (such as those on deforestation and tripling renewable energy capacity) from the final MWP text. This was widely viewed as a considerable "big step back" from the progress made at COP28.8 This outcome suggests that the intense political focus on securing a finance deal may have come at the cost of maintaining momentum on specific mitigation actions, particularly those related to fossil fuels.

Gender Action Plan: COP29 extended the Lima Work Programme on Gender and its associated Gender Action Plan for another 10 years and launched a new gender action plan, inviting proposals for its scope.11 Parties were encouraged to appoint gender focal points and enhance reporting. However, the decision notably avoided explicit financial commitments for gender-responsive climate action, reflecting a broader reluctance from some developed countries to create new dedicated funding streams outside the main finance negotiations.17 Furthermore, proposals to enhance national reporting of gender-disaggregated data faced opposition, with some countries citing capacity constraints.11

The "Baku-Belem Roadmap to $1.3T" 11 and the deferral of the GGA review 8 can be interpreted as procedural mechanisms. While they acknowledge the scale of financial needs and the complexity of adaptation assessment, they also serve to postpone more difficult negotiations and substantial commitments to future COPs, particularly COP30. This pattern of creating "roadmaps" or deferring reviews is common in multilateral negotiations when immediate consensus on ambitious, binding action proves elusive. It allows Parties to signal intent and keep critical issues on the agenda while effectively pushing the responsibility for delivering more concrete outcomes to subsequent presidencies and negotiating sessions.

IV. Major Events and Initiatives During COP29

Beyond the formal negotiation tracks, COP29 hosted a variety of high-level segments, national announcements, and initiatives from non-Party stakeholders, contributing to the broader discourse on climate action.

High-Level Segments and Keynote Addresses:

The summit featured addresses from numerous world leaders, offering diverse national perspectives and reflecting the global complexities of climate change. For instance, Albania's Prime Minister voiced a common sentiment of frustration over the gap between eloquent climate speeches and tangible real-world action. Iran's Vice President highlighted the impact of unilateral sanctions on climate efforts and underscored the historical responsibility of developed nations for the current climate situation, while asserting developing countries' right to development. The Vatican's Secretary of State, Cardinal Pietro Parolin, spoke compellingly of an "ecological debt" owed by the global North to the South, advocating for a new, human-centered global financial architecture rooted in equity and justice. Greece's Prime Minister Kyriakos Mitsotakis brought a pragmatic tone, emphasizing the need for sincerity regarding the socio-economic trade-offs involved in the energy transition and cautioning against a pace that could undermine competitiveness.18

UN Secretary-General António Guterres, a consistent voice for higher ambition, acknowledged that while he had hoped for a more robust outcome on both finance and mitigation, the agreement reached in Baku provided a foundational base upon which future efforts could build.2

The Baku Dialogue on Water for Climate Action:

A notable initiative launched by the COP29 Presidency, in collaboration with key UN agencies such as the UN Economic Commission for Europe (UNECE), UN Environment Programme (UNEP), and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), was the "Baku Dialogue on Water for Climate Action".19 This dialogue was conceived to address the significant underrepresentation of water-related issues within global climate policy and action, despite water being central to climate impacts – from floods and droughts to escalating water insecurity.19

The objectives of the Baku Dialogue are multifaceted: to promote dialogue and partnerships at international, regional, and basin levels; to strengthen the generation and sharing of scientific evidence on the impacts of climate change on water resources; to enhance water-related climate policy actions; and critically, to mainstream water considerations into climate policy, finance, and implementation strategies.19 It aims to function as a continuous COP-to-COP collaboration platform, ensuring coherence across related international conventions.21 As part of this initiative, the "COP29 Declaration on Water for Climate Action" was presented and opened for endorsements from Parties and non-Party stakeholders.19 By early 2025, this declaration had garnered endorsements from 67 countries and 25 non-state actors, indicating a degree of international support for elevating water within the climate agenda.21 The proliferation of such thematic "Dialogues" and "Initiatives" championed by COP Presidencies is a discernible trend. While these can be valuable for raising awareness and fostering collaboration on specific under-addressed issues, there is an accompanying risk. If not carefully integrated with the core negotiation tracks and backed by concrete action plans and dedicated funding, such initiatives could, as some analysts have warned, become a "distraction from the ‘ambition homework’ that governments should now be undertaking".11 Their long-term efficacy will depend on sustained engagement and their ability to translate dialogue into tangible, funded outcomes within the formal UNFCCC process.

Significant National Announcements:

One of the most prominent national announcements during COP29 came from the United Kingdom. The UK Prime Minister declared the country's new 2035 Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC), committing to reduce all greenhouse gas emissions by at least 81% by 2035 compared to 1990 levels (this target excludes emissions from international aviation and shipping).2 This announcement was made well ahead of the official February 2025 deadline for NDC submissions for the period 2031-2035.22 The UK positioned this target as being aligned with a 1.5°C warming pathway, economy-wide in its coverage, and informed by the latest scientific advice and the outcomes of the COP28 Global Stocktake.23

Contributions and Announcements from Non-Party Stakeholders:

COP29 also served as a platform for a multitude of announcements and events hosted by international organizations, NGOs, and other non-Party stakeholders. These highlighted the diverse and cross-cutting nature of climate impacts and action. For example, the UN High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) released its first-ever report on climate displacement. The World Food Programme (WFP) maintained a significant presence, underscoring food security links. The World Trade Organization (WTO) hosted events on trade and climate. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) provided updates on the State of the Global Climate. The International Renewable Energy Agency (IRENA) issued calls for NDCs 3.0 to align with the global goal of tripling renewable energy capacity. The International Fund for Agricultural Development (IFAD) advocated for increased financial support for small-scale farmers. The World Health Organization (WHO) organized events focusing on the health impacts of climate change. Additionally, the Group on Earth Observations (GEO) and UN Climate Change launched a joint policy brief on leveraging early warning technologies for climate resilience.24

A novel event at COP29 was the first-ever Human Development Day, held on November 18, which saw the launch of the "Baku Initiative on Human Development for Climate Resilience." This initiative aims to address the critical intersection of climate resilience and human well-being, focusing on education, health, social protection, and equitable employment opportunities.9 The sheer volume and breadth of these activities by specialized UN agencies and other international organizations underscore a crucial development: climate change is increasingly recognized not as an isolated environmental issue, but as a fundamental development challenge that intersects with virtually all sectors of human activity and societal well-being. This mainstreaming necessitates more integrated and holistic approaches to policymaking and action, moving beyond traditional environmental silos and fostering greater inter-agency and cross-sectoral collaboration.

V. Negotiation Dynamics and Contentious Issues

The negotiations at COP29 were characterized by deep divisions on several key issues, primarily revolving around the scale and nature of climate finance, the urgency of mitigation action, and the pathways to a just transition.

The Climate Finance Debate (NCQG): Developed vs. Developing Country Perspectives:

The quantum, or size, of the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) was the central and most fiercely contested issue.6 Developing countries, often represented by the G77+China negotiating bloc, argued for significantly higher public finance contributions from developed nations. Their demands were rooted in principles of historical responsibility for emissions and the immense scale of financial need to address climate impacts and undertake low-carbon transitions. Figures cited ranged from $1.3 trillion by 2035 specifically from historic emitters 6 to annual public finance needs of up to $900 billion.8

In stark contrast, developed countries maintained a strategic silence on specific financial figures until very late in the negotiation process.8 When figures were eventually tabled, they were met with strong condemnation from many developing countries, who described them as "paltry," "a joke," and "totally unacceptable".7 The final agreed target of "at least $300 billion" annually in public finance from developed countries by 2035 was widely perceived by recipient nations and many observers as grossly inadequate to meet the challenge.2

Beyond the headline figure, several other aspects of the NCQG were highly contentious. These included the definition and sources of finance (particularly the balance between public and private finance, and grants versus loans), the methodologies for counting contributions from Multilateral Development Banks, and a newly introduced expectation for voluntary financial contributions from developing countries themselves.8 The negotiation process itself also drew heavy criticism, with developing countries accusing the COP29 Presidency of mismanagement and of forcing through a deal in the final hours without adequate consultation or allowing for formal objections from dissatisfied Parties.6 This contentious dynamic around finance was not isolated; it permeated and influenced nearly all other negotiation tracks.11 Progress on critical issues such as adaptation, the just transition, and even mitigation ambition was frequently stymied or slowed by unresolved disagreements over financial commitments and responsibilities. This underscores that finance is not merely a standalone agenda item but a fundamental enabler—or disabler—of progress across the entire spectrum of climate action.

The difficulties in reaching a satisfactory agreement on the NCQG also exacerbated an existing "trust deficit" between developed and developing nations. The historical failure of developed countries to meet the previous $100 billion annual climate finance goal by the 2020 deadline, compounded by what many developing countries perceived as delaying tactics and insufficient offers on the NCQG at COP29, deepened this mistrust.4 Such a deficit makes good-faith negotiations and the achievement of ambitious, mutually agreeable compromises significantly more challenging.

Discussions on Fossil Fuels and Mitigation Ambition:

COP29 marked a notable lack of progress, and arguably a regression, on the issue of fossil fuels and overall mitigation ambition. The conference failed to build upon the landmark agreement at COP28 to "transition away from fossil fuels".9 Draft texts for key decisions at COP29 were observed to have omitted references to this crucial commitment.9

A significant factor in this stalemate was the reported obstruction by Saudi Arabia, which allegedly blocked any references to fossil fuels in the text of the UAE Dialogue – a process intended to follow up on the outcomes of the COP28 Global Stocktake.6 This opposition, described by some observers as "destructive" 8, led to the deferral of these critical discussions to 2025. This strategic blocking by a key nation demonstrates a persistent vulnerability within the consensus-based nature of UNFCCC negotiations, where individual Parties or small groups can significantly stall progress on issues vital to the majority.

Furthermore, the Mitigation Work Programme (MWP), another avenue for advancing ambition, was perceived to have been substantially weakened. Reports indicated that all mentions of fossil fuels, as well as references to key COP28 pledges concerning deforestation, fossil fuel subsidies, and the tripling of renewable energy capacity, were removed from the final MWP text.8 This outcome was characterized by some developed country envoys as a "big step back" 8, signaling a clear loss of momentum on direct mitigation measures related to the primary drivers of climate change.

Challenges in the Just Transition Work Programme (JTWP):

Negotiations on the Just Transition Work Programme (JTWP) also ended in deadlock, with COP29 closing without an agreement on how to take this critical agenda item forward.8 The JTWP is intended to support workers and communities affected by the shift away from fossil fuels and towards cleaner energy systems.

The main points of disagreement centered on the scope and financing of the programme. Developed countries reportedly pushed for a JTWP with a primary focus on the mitigation aspects of the transition. In contrast, developing countries advocated for a broader scope that would also encompass adaptation, the provision of finance, technology transfer, and capacity building, all underpinned by principles of equity and common but differentiated responsibilities.8 A major sticking point was the lack of commitment to designate specific finance to support the development and implementation of just transition plans, a red line for many developing countries.8

Debates Surrounding Adaptation Finance and Indicators:

Progress on the Global Goal on Adaptation (GGA) was also hampered by familiar challenges. The unwillingness of some developed countries to commit dedicated and scaled-up finance for adaptation action remained a significant barrier.8 Additionally, technical difficulties and political sensitivities surrounding the selection of indicators to effectively measure progress towards the GGA contributed to the slow pace of negotiations.8

The concept of "transformational adaptation," which implies deep, long-term societal changes to build resilience, was another point of debate. While promoted by some developed countries as a necessary approach, it was met with caution by certain developing nations who expressed concerns that it could introduce new conditionalities or complexities that might hinder access to adaptation finance.8 The final text included a compromise by recognizing transformational adaptation.17 Discussions on "means of implementation" (MOI) for adaptation were also contentious throughout the conference. The final language was softened to refer to "enablers of implementation," which combined demands for financial support with enabling conditions such as governance and transparency.17

VI. Stakeholder Reactions and Global Analysis

The outcomes of COP29 elicited a wide spectrum of reactions from participating nations, international organizations, civil society, and climate experts, generally reflecting a sense of modest achievement mixed with significant disappointment regarding the overall level of ambition.

Perspectives from Developing Nations and Small Island States (AOSIS):

Developing countries, particularly the Least Developed Countries (LDCs) and Small Island Developing States (SIDS) represented by AOSIS, expressed profound disappointment with the central outcome on climate finance. The NCQG's commitment of "at least $300 billion" annually in public finance from developed countries by 2035 was overwhelmingly condemned as "paltry," "a joke," and "too little, too late".2 These nations consistently emphasized that this figure falls drastically short of the trillions of dollars estimated to be needed annually to enable them to mitigate emissions, adapt to escalating climate impacts, and address unavoidable loss and damage.6 The deep dissatisfaction was underscored by the decision of AOSIS to walk out of the NCQG negotiations in protest over the perceived inadequacy of the offer.2

Beyond the quantum of finance, developing countries also voiced strong criticisms regarding the negotiation process itself. There were widespread accusations of mismanagement by the COP29 Presidency, a lack of transparency in how draft texts were developed, and instances where deals were reportedly forced through without adequate consultation or allowing dissenting Parties, such as India, Nigeria, and Bolivia, to formally state their objections or have them adequately addressed.6 Concerns were also raised about the terms of finance, with fears that an over-reliance on loans, rather than grants, within the NCQG framework could exacerbate already severe debt crises in many vulnerable nations.17

Positions of Developed Countries:

Developed countries, on the other hand, tended to frame the $300 billion public finance figure as a significant step forward, often highlighting that it represents a tripling of the previous $100 billion annual floor.6 They also actively pushed for a broadening of the contributor base for climate finance, with language in the NCQG encouraging voluntary contributions from wealthier developing countries.8 This narrative subtly attempts to shift some of the financial responsibility towards emerging economies. However, not all developed countries were uniformly satisfied with the overall outcomes. For instance, Canada's Environment and Climate Change Minister publicly expressed disappointment with what was termed a "deplorable" lack of ambition from the Baku leadership.6 In contrast, the United Kingdom sought to position itself as a leader by highlighting its own ambitious 2035 NDC announcement made during the conference.23

Critiques and Endorsements from Environmental NGOs and Civil Society:

Environmental NGOs and civil society observers were largely critical of COP29's outcomes. The vast majority condemned the finance deal as woefully inadequate and viewed the overall results as insufficient to meet the escalating urgency of the climate crisis.2 There was a palpable sense of frustration that the political process was failing to deliver action commensurate with scientific warnings and the articulated needs of the most vulnerable populations.

Concerns were also frequently voiced about the transparency of the negotiating procedures, the human rights and environmental record of the host country (Azerbaijan), and the perceived influence of fossil fuel interests on the COP process.2 The perceived shortcomings of the conference led some prominent climate leaders to publicly question whether the current COP system is "fit for purpose".2 A noticeable trend at COP29 was a more vocal and, at times, more assertive stance from campaigners, with some advocating for the outright rejection of what they saw as unacceptably weak deals.7 Reactions to the finalization of Article 6 rules were mixed: while some welcomed the establishment of a framework after years of delay, many others remained deeply concerned about the potential for loopholes that could undermine environmental integrity and the transparency of the new carbon market mechanisms.8

Analysis from Climate Scientists and International Organizations:

Climate scientists and representatives from international organizations continued to underscore the scientific imperatives for urgent and deep emissions reductions. They reiterated stark warnings about the rapidly closing window of opportunity to limit global warming to 1.5°C and highlighted the escalating frequency and intensity of climate-related impacts worldwide.5 Organizations like UNCTAD provided analyses that starkly illustrated the massive and growing gap between the financial pledges made within the UNFCCC context and the actual estimated needs for mitigation, adaptation, and addressing loss and damage.6

The UN Secretary-General, António Guterres, while expressing his hope for a more ambitious outcome, particularly on finance and mitigation, acknowledged that the agreement reached in Baku did provide a "base on which to build" for future efforts.2 Similarly, the UNFCCC Executive Secretary, Simon Stiell, emphasized the critical importance of accountability, stressing that financial promises, like any insurance policy, only work "if premiums are paid in full, and on time".6

The collective reactions from these diverse stakeholders reveal a widening chasm between the rhetoric of climate ambition and the reality of negotiated outcomes. The persistent gap between scientific warnings, the clearly articulated needs of vulnerable nations, and the commitments delivered through the COP process fuels growing disillusionment and raises fundamental questions about the efficacy of the current multilateral climate governance system.2 Furthermore, the COP process itself came under increased scrutiny at COP29. Criticisms regarding its transparency, operational efficiency, and susceptibility to host country influence or powerful lobbying interests were prominent.2 Incidents such as the controversial "carbon coup" during the adoption of Article 6 rules 6 and widespread complaints about the handling of the NCQG negotiations 17 only served to intensify these concerns, suggesting a need for reflection and potential reform of the UNFCCC process to ensure it can facilitate more effective and equitable global climate action.

VII. COP29 in Perspective: Comparison with COP28 and Outlook for COP30

Understanding the significance of COP29 requires placing its outcomes in the context of the preceding conference, COP28, and looking ahead to the critical tasks facing COP30 in Belém, Brazil.

Key Shifts in Focus and Progress from COP28 to COP29:

A primary distinction between the two conferences lay in their thematic emphasis. COP28, held in Dubai, was marked by its landmark outcome on fossil fuels, with Parties agreeing for the first time to language on "transitioning away from fossil fuels in energy systems".4 It also concluded the first Global Stocktake (GST), which provided a comprehensive assessment of collective progress towards the Paris Agreement goals and identified significant shortfalls.4 In contrast, COP29 in Baku was explicitly designated as the "finance COP," with its central mandate being the establishment of the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance.2

However, on the issue of fossil fuels, COP29 represented a regression from the momentum generated at COP28. Attempts to reaffirm or build upon the COP28 commitment to transition away from fossil fuels stalled, and such language was notably absent or weakened in key texts emerging from Baku, including the Mitigation Work Programme and decisions related to the follow-up of the UAE Dialogue on implementing GST outcomes.6

Conversely, COP29 achieved a significant breakthrough where previous COPs, including to some extent COP28, had struggled: the finalization of the operational rules for Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, governing international carbon markets.9 This had been a long-standing piece of unfinished business from the Paris Rulebook. In terms of overarching goals, COP28 saw agreements to triple global renewable energy capacity and double energy efficiency by 2030, and to boost climate resilience. COP29 was intended to provide the financial means to achieve these and other climate objectives, but the adequacy of the finance package agreed upon remains a major point of contention.9

Table 4: Comparison of Key Commitments: COP28 vs. COP29

Laying the Groundwork for COP30 in Belém, Brazil: Unfinished Business and Future Priorities:

The outcomes of COP29, particularly its shortcomings, cast a long shadow over the preparations for COP30, to be hosted by Brazil in Belém in November 2025. A critical deadline looms: all Parties to the Paris Agreement are required to submit new or updated, and more ambitious, Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs 3.0) by early 2025, well ahead of COP30.2 These NDCs, which outline national climate action plans for the post-2030 period, are pivotal. They must collectively align with the Paris Agreement's goal of limiting global warming to 1.5°C above pre-industrial levels.5 Given the insufficient mitigation ambition evident at COP29 and the stark warnings from the first Global Stocktake, COP30 is shaping up to be a "make or break" moment for the credibility of the 1.5°C target. Its success or failure in securing genuinely ambitious NDCs, backed by a credible and scaled-up financial package, will significantly determine the feasibility of keeping this critical temperature limit within reach.

The "Baku-Belem Roadmap to $1.3T," launched at COP29, will be a central track for discussions on scaling up climate finance in the lead-up to and at COP30.11 The credibility of this roadmap and its ability to translate aspirational figures into concrete financial flows will be paramount for rebuilding trust and enabling higher ambition from developing countries.

A substantial amount of unfinished business from COP29 will also carry over to COP30. This includes the urgent need to address the stalled discussions on the fossil fuel phase-out, to strengthen the Mitigation Work Programme with concrete actions, to finally reach an agreement on the Just Transition Work Programme (including its financing), and to make substantive progress on the Global Goal on Adaptation, particularly concerning dedicated financial support and robust indicators.8

Cross-cutting themes of transparency and accountability will also be central to COP30. There is a persistent call for greater transparency in the development and implementation of NDCs and financial commitments, alongside the establishment of robust mechanisms to track progress and ensure accountability for meeting targets.5 Rebuilding the trust that was significantly eroded during the contentious finance negotiations at COP29 will be an essential, albeit challenging, prerequisite for a successful outcome in Belém.

The "Baku-Belem Roadmap" and the continuation of various dialogues and work programmes between formal COP sessions highlight an increasing reliance on inter-sessional work and processes that span multiple COPs.8 The commitment by the COP28 and incoming COP29 Presidencies to ensure a transparent and inclusive process in the lead-up to Baku 29 exemplifies this trend. This suggests a growing recognition within the UNFCCC system that the traditional two-week annual negotiation period is insufficient to resolve the complex and deeply political issues at stake. Continuous engagement, facilitated by current and incoming presidencies (often referred to as the "Troika" of past, present, and future COP hosts), is becoming increasingly crucial for laying the groundwork for major decisions and maintaining momentum between conferences.

VIII. Conclusion: The Legacy of COP29 and the Path Forward

COP29 in Baku will be remembered for delivering a long-awaited agreement on the operational rules for Article 6 carbon markets and for establishing a New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance. The finalization of Article 6 provides a much-needed framework that could, if implemented with high integrity, channel significant investment towards emissions reduction activities globally. The NCQG, while tripling the previous annual floor for public finance from developed countries to $300 billion by 2035 and setting a broader $1.3 trillion annual aspiration from all sources, represents a modest step forward when measured against the scientifically assessed needs and the demands of developing nations.

However, these successes were overshadowed by significant shortcomings. The failure to advance ambitious global mitigation action, particularly concerning a clear pathway to transition away from fossil fuels, marked a concerning stall, if not a regression, from the direction set at COP28. The deep dissatisfaction expressed by developing countries regarding the scale, terms, and negotiation process of the NCQG has further strained the already fragile trust between the global North and South. While incremental progress was noted in areas such as adaptation discussions and the extension of the Gender Action Plan, transformative breakthroughs remained elusive.

The path forward from COP29 is fraught with critical challenges but also presents vital opportunities. The foremost challenge is the mobilization of climate finance at the scale and speed commensurate with the crisis. The $1.3 trillion annual aspiration needs a credible, actionable roadmap, ensuring that finance flows from diverse sources and effectively reaches the most vulnerable communities and countries in forms that do not exacerbate debt.

The upcoming cycle for submitting new and enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by early 2025, ahead of COP30 in Belém, stands as a pivotal opportunity. These NDCs must collectively demonstrate a significant ratcheting up of global ambition to align with the 1.5°C temperature goal. This requires robust "ambition homework" at the national level 11, translating international commitments into concrete domestic policies and measures.5 The success of the Paris Agreement ultimately hinges not just on what is agreed at COPs, but on the diligent implementation of these national plans.

Rebuilding trust between developed and developing nations is paramount. This necessitates not only fulfilling existing financial pledges but also engaging in good-faith negotiations that acknowledge historical responsibilities and contemporary capacities. Confronting the political and economic barriers to an accelerated and just transition away from fossil fuels remains a central, unavoidable task.

Finally, COP29 has amplified concerns about the multilateral climate process itself. The conference, like many before it, largely delivered incremental progress in a context demanding exponential, transformative change.6 This fundamental mismatch between the pace of negotiation and the urgency of the climate crisis raises profound questions about the capacity of the current UNFCCC framework to deliver the necessary speed and scale of action. Addressing these concerns and strengthening the effectiveness and equity of global climate governance will be crucial if the international community is to navigate the increasingly perilous path towards a sustainable and climate-resilient future.

Thoughts



Initial Research Focus

I'm starting my research by gathering the foundational details of the COP29 conference, including its location, specific dates, and who is leading the event. This will provide a solid base for understanding the context of the conference.

Key Agenda and Events

My next step involves delving into the core agenda items and the various negotiation tracks that were pursued during COP29. A significant area of focus will be the new climate finance goal, as this is often a critical point of discussion in these conferences. I'll also be looking for information on any major events, significant speeches, or important announcements that took place.

Outcomes and Disagreements

I'll then shift my attention to identifying the main negotiated outcomes and the final agreement text that emerged from COP29. It's equally important to understand any points of contention or disagreement that arose among participating nations, as these often highlight the challenges in achieving consensus on climate action.

Reactions and Future Implications

Finally, I plan to explore how various stakeholders reacted to and analyzed the outcomes of COP29. I'll also compare the results of COP29 with those of COP28 to understand the progression of climate action and consider the implications for future efforts, including the upcoming COP30.

Conference Fundamentals

I've successfully gathered the core details for COP29. It was held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from November 11 to 22, 2024. The conference concluded on November 24, 2024, after negotiations extended beyond the scheduled end date. I also found information regarding the appointment of the President-Designate and Lead Negotiator for COP29.

Key Outcomes and Finance Goal

A central outcome of COP29 was the agreement on a new climate finance goal, the 'new collective quantified goal' (NCQG). This aims for an overall aspirational goal of $1.3 trillion per year, with developed countries committing to at least $300 billion annually from 2035. This figure, however, was met with significant criticism from developing countries, who deemed it insufficient compared to their estimated needs. The 'Baku-Belem Roadmap to 1.3T' was launched to scale up finance in 2025. Additionally, the design of the Article 6.4 mechanism for international carbon markets appears to be complete, allowing it to start operating.

Points of Contention

The climate finance goal was a major point of contention, with developing nations expressing strong dissatisfaction with the $300 billion target. There was also a notable lack of progress on the 'transition away from fossil fuels' decision from COP28, with Saudi Arabia reportedly blocking references to fossil fuels in the text. Furthermore, an agreement on the Just Transition Work Programme (JTWP) was not reached, primarily due to disagreements on finance and the scope of the program. Discussions around gender and climate change also faced tensions regarding explicit finance commitments and national reporting of gender-disaggregated data.

Broader Implications and Future Steps

COP29 was largely seen as a 'technical COP' focused on finance, but it highlighted the ongoing financial and political gaps between wealthier and poorer nations. While some progress was made on carbon markets and the operationalization of the Loss and Damage Fund, the pledges to the fund are still a fraction of the estimated needs. The conference's outcomes set the stage for COP30 in Belém, Brazil, with a clear need for more ambitious Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) by early 2025 to align with the 1.5°C global warming limit. I'm now synthesizing these findings to provide a comprehensive overview of the conference, including key takeaways and events, and will continue to look deeper into the documents to extract more nuanced details.

Key Conference Details Confirmed

I've confirmed that COP29 took place in Baku, Azerbaijan, from November 11 to 22, 2024, with negotiations extending to November 24. While I have information about the President-Designate, I'm still working to identify the specific individual who served as the President of COP29.

Climate Finance and Carbon Markets

A significant outcome was the agreement on the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) for climate finance, aiming for an aspirational $1.3 trillion per year, with developed countries committing to at least $300 billion annually by 2035. This figure, however, has been widely criticized by developing nations as insufficient. I also learned that the rules for the international carbon market under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement were finalized, which is a notable step forward after years of negotiations.

Areas of Disagreement and Unresolved Issues

Despite some progress, COP29 saw considerable contention, particularly regarding the climate finance goal and the lack of advancement on the 'transition away from fossil fuels' commitment from COP28. The Just Transition Work Programme also failed to reach an agreement, highlighting ongoing divisions. These unresolved issues underscore the challenges in achieving global consensus on critical climate actions.

Next Steps in My Research

To provide a more comprehensive overview, I'm now focusing on identifying the specific President of COP29, gathering more detailed objectives and outcomes of the 'Baku Dialogue on Water for Climate Action', and delving deeper into the key provisions of the Article 6 carbon market agreement. I also plan to find more direct quotes and statements from various stakeholders to better illustrate their reactions, and to get more specific details on the UK's Nationally Determined Contribution (NDC) announced at the conference.
