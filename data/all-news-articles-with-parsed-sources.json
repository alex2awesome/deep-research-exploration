{"title":"Australia kills off carbon tax","author":"Lenore Taylor","content":"Australia\u2019s carbon price has been repealed, leaving the nation with no legislated policy to achieve even the minimum 5% greenhouse emissions reduction target it has inscribed in international agreements.\n\nAfter eight years of bitter political debate, during which climate policy dominated three election campaigns and contributed to the demise of two prime ministers, after last week\u2019s Senate drama in which the repeal was again defeated and this week\u2019s lengthy last gasp debate, the Senate has now finally voted to make good Tony Abbott\u2019s \u201cpledge in blood\u201d to \u201caxe the tax\u201d.\n\nThe government was backed by seven of the new crossbench senators, including the three Palmer United party senators, Liberal Democrat senator David Leyonhjelm, Family First senator Bob Day, Motoring Enthusiast senator Ricky Muir, DLP senator John Madigan. Independent senator Nick Xenophon was unwell.\n\nOnly the Australian Labor party and the Greens voted against repealing the carbon pricing scheme they introduced, which came into effect two years ago.\n\nLeader of the government in the Senate and former climate change minister Penny Wong said repealing the bills meant \u201cthis nation will have walked away from a credible and efficient response to climate change\u201d.\n\nWong said the prime minister Tony Abbott had \u201cstaked his political career \u2026 on fearmongering and scaremongering and that is what this debate has been about for years\u201d.\n\n\u201cI think future generations will look back on these bills and they will be appalled \u2026 at the short-sighted, opportunistic selfish politics of those opposite and Mr Abbott will go down as one of the most short-sighted, selfish and small people ever to occupy the office of prime minister.\u201d\n\nGovernment backbencher Ian Macdonald accused opposition parties of being hypocrites for refusing to accept the will of the voters and said that while he had \u201can open mind\u201d, he would like to point out that Brisbane had recently had its coldest day in 113 years.\n\nGreens leader Christine Milne said it was \u201ca vote for failure\u201d amid interjections from government backbenchers that she should \u201cget over it\u201d because the parliament was \u201crespecting the will of the Australian people.\u201d\n\nHow the Senate voted\n\nThe bills passed 39:32. There was none of the jubilation that accompanied their passage in the lower house, but the leader of the government in the Senate, Eric Abetz, shook hands with backbench senator Cory Bernardi, who led the revolt against Malcolm Turnbull when, as leader of the opposition, he backed Labor\u2019s carbon pricing scheme.\n\nThe tax was $25.40 a tonne and was scheduled to move to the floating and lower international price in 12 months.\n\nThe repeal will cost the budget around $7bn over the next four years as around 350 businesses, mainly electricity generators and big manufacturers, no longer have to pay the tax.\n\nThe government argues the carbon pricing scheme has been ineffective, but national emissions have actually fallen by 0.8% in the first calendar year of its operation, the largest fall in 24 years of records. Since the tax began, emissions from the east coast electricity market have fallen 11%, but emissions from other sources \u2013 especially coal and gas mining have increased.\n\nThe government also says households will be better off by an average $550 \u2013 the amount treasury estimated prices would rise when the tax was introduced \u2013 but supermarkets and airlines are now saying consumers should not expect price reductions.\n\nThe Australian Competition and Consumer Commission\u2019s special powers are to monitor and enforce only electricity and gas price reductions. Electricity bills will rise, but by an estimated 9% less than they otherwise would. Gas bills will rise by an estimated 7% less than they would have with the tax still in place.\n\nThe Abbott government says it will now achieve the target of a 5% reduction in Australian emissions compared with 2000 levels by 2020 with its Direct Action policy, which will offer $2.5bn in competitive grants over the next four years to companies and organisations voluntarily reducing emissions. The budget actually allocated only $1.14bn over the four-year forward estimates for the scheme. The government said this is because they will pay on delivery of the abatement. The policy is voluntary and puts no overall cap on emissions.\n\nThe government itself has not modelled Direct Action (Abbott said he would prefer to \u201chave a crack\u201d), but two other modelling exercises found even the 5% cut would cost far more than $2.5bn, and the independent climate change authority \u2013 which the government is seeking to abolish \u2013 has said Australia\u2019s \u201cfair share\u201d of international emissions reductions has now increased to between 15% and 19% by 2020.\n\nThe government says it is sure Direct Action will meet the 5% target, but Abbott has said he will not allocate any more money even if it does not, and has not said how he would make deeper reductions in Australia\u2019s emissions which are likely to be required after the United Nations meeting to try to forge a new post-2020 climate agreement in Paris next year.\n\nMalcolm Turnbull warned of the long-term costs of the policy in a speech to parliament after he was deposed as leader because of his support for an emissions trading scheme, when he said Direct Action style schemes were \u201ca recipe for fiscal recklessness on a grand scale\u201d.\n\nThe carbon price repeal bills were voted down in the Senate last week after a last-minute change to a Palmer United party amendment was ruled to be unconstitutional by the clerk of the Senate. The government had been prepared to accept the amendment but then changed it again over the weekend after business groups raised major concerns.\n\nBusiness groups welcomed the repeal as a \u201cfirst step\u201d towards achieving an effective emissions reduction policy.\n\nThe Business Council of Australia, the Minerals Council of Australia and the Australian Industry Group called on the government to \u201cdevelop and implement a cost-effective emissions reduction fund\u201d as \u201cpart of a toolkit of measures to reduce emissions\u201d.\n\nBut the Climate Institute thinktank said that \u201cby repealing laws that price and limit carbon pollution, Australia today became the world\u2019s first country to dismantle a functioning and effective carbon market, taking a monumentally reckless backward leap even as other major countries are stepping up climate action\u201d.\n\nAnd the Australian Conservation Foundation said: \u201cThis backwards step makes Australia an international embarrassment.\u201d\n\nDescribing it as a \u201ctragic day\u201d, Greens leader senator Christine Milne said after the vote that \u201cthe big polluters should pay for the destruction they are causing to the planet\u201d. She accused the Coalition of \u201cwanting to cost-shift the burden of climate change onto the community and away from the people who are causing it\u201d.\n\nBoth Labor and the Greens say they remain committed to carbon pricing as the best way to reduce emissions.\n\nSpeaking after the vote, agriculture minister Barnaby Joyce said the tax had imposed high costs on families, and questioned whether it was needed, saying \u201clook at the weather today, look at the way you are dressed, no one thinks it is too hot\u201d.\n\n\u201cI believe there is climate change happening, I just don\u2019t believe we are going to change it with a broad-based consumption tax.\u201d\n\n\u201cI am glad the carbon tax has been axed \u2026 we have Direct Action and there are programs that hopefully can assist \u2026 but the idea that somehow we inflict on every household the fact that we would attack their power prices to the Australian taxation offices. They took it to the Australian people and the Australian people rejected it,\u201d Joyce said.","issue":"australia-carbon-tax","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/environment\/2014\/jul\/17\/australia-kills-off-carbon-tax","sources":[{"Name":"Penny Wong","Biography":"Leader of the government in the Senate and former climate change minister","Information":"Penny Wong expressed strong disapproval over the repeal of Australia's carbon pricing scheme, stating that it meant Australia walked away from a credible and efficient response to climate change.

{"title":"Carbon Pricing in Australia","author":"Wikipedia Contributors","content":"A carbon pricing scheme in Australia was introduced by the Gillard Labor minority government in 2011 as the Clean Energy Act 2011 which came into effect on 1 July 2012. Emissions from companies subject to the scheme dropped 7% upon its introduction.[2] As a result of being in place for such a short time, and because the then Opposition leader Tony Abbott indicated he intended to repeal \"the carbon tax\", regulated organizations responded rather weakly, with very few investments in emissions reductions being made.[3] The scheme was repealed on 17 July 2014, backdated to 1 July 2014. In its place, the Abbott government set up the Emission Reduction Fund in December 2014. Emissions thereafter resumed their growth evident before the tax.[4]\n\nThe carbon price was part of a broad energy reform package called the Clean Energy Futures Plan, which aimed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in Australia by 5% below 2000 levels by 2020 and 80% below 2000 levels by 2050. Although Australia does not levy a direct carbon price,[5] the plan set out to achieve these targets by encouraging Australia's largest emitters to increase energy efficiency and invest in sustainable energy. The scheme was administered by the Clean Energy Regulator. Compensation to industry and households was funded by the revenue derived from the charge. The scheme required entities which emit over 25,000 tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent greenhouse gases per year, and which were not in the transport or agriculture sectors, to obtain emissions permits, called carbon units. Carbon units were either purchased from the government or issued free as part of industry assistance measures. As part of the scheme, personal income tax was reduced for those earning less than A$80,000 per year and the tax-free threshold was increased from A$6,000 to A$18,200.[6] Initially, the price of a permit for one tonne of carbon was fixed at A$23 for the 2012\u201313 financial year, with unlimited permits being available from the government. The fixed price rose to A$24.15 for 2013\u201314.\n\nThe government had announced that the scheme was part of a transition to an emissions trading scheme in 2014\u201315, where the available permits will be limited in line with a pollution cap. The scheme primarily applied to electricity generators and industrial sectors. It did not apply to road transport and agriculture. The Department of Climate Change and Energy Efficiency stated that in June 2013 only 260 entities were subject to the scheme,[7] of which approximately 185 were liable to pay for carbon units. Domestic aviation did not face the carbon price scheme, but was subject to an additional fuel excise levy of approximately 6 cents per liter.\n\nIn February 2012, the Sydney Morning Herald reported that the Clean Energy Future carbon price scheme had not deterred new investment in the coal industry, as spending on exploration had increased by 62% in 2010\u20132011, more than any other mineral commodity. The government agency Geoscience Australia reported that investment in coal prospecting reached $520 million in 2010\u20132011.[8] Falls in carbon emissions were observed following implementation of this policy.[9] It was noted that emissions from sectors subject to the pricing mechanism were 1.0% lower[10] and nine months after the introduction of the pricing scheme, Australia's carbon dioxide emissions from electricity generation had fallen to a 10-year low, with coal generation down 11% from 2008 to 2009.[11] However, attribution of these trends to carbon pricing have been disputed, with Frontier Economics claiming trends are largely explained by factors unrelated to the carbon tax.[12][13] Electricity demand had been falling and in 2012 was at the lowest level seen since 2006 in the National Electricity Market.[14]\n\nAustralia's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Mt CO2 equiv Sector Year 2012 Energy \u2013 Electricity 190.8 Stationary energy excluding electricity 94.2 Transport 91.5 Fugitive emissions 42.3 Industrial processes 32.3 Agriculture 88.0 Waste 12.8 Total 551.9 Excludes land use, land use change and forestry Source \u2013 Australia's National Greenhouse Inventory Dec 2012","issue":"australia-carbon-tax","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Carbon_pricing_in_Australia","sources":[{"Name":"Gillard Labor Government","Biography":"The Gillard Labor government was a minority Australian government led by the Australian Labor Party under Prime Minister Julia Gillard from June 2010 to June 2013.","Information":"The Gillard Labor government introduced the carbon pricing mechanism in Australia as part of the Clean Energy Act 2011.

{"title":"Australia's key climate policy faces an uncertain future","author":"Tom Lowrey","content":"Some business and climate groups have voiced their support for keeping one of the federal government's key climate policies in place, with the Coalition yet to commit to its future.\n\nThe safeguard mechanism was introduced under the Turnbull government nearly a decade ago, but was significantly strengthened under the Albanese government.\n\nIt caps the emissions of the country's heaviest-emitting companies and projects, and successively lowers that limit by roughly 5 per cent each year.\n\nTo stick to their caps, companies have to either lower their emissions or buy 'carbon credits'.\n\nIt's a key plank of the government's efforts to reach a 43 per cent reduction in emissions by 2030, and net zero by 2050.\n\nThe Coalition opposed the changes at the time and has kept up its criticism, but is yet to spell out whether it plans any changes to the scheme should it win government.\n\nIn a speech earlier this year, Peter Dutton compared it to the unpopular 'carbon pollution reduction scheme' introduced under the Gillard government \u2014 better known as the carbon tax.\n\n\"We've seen the safeguard mechanism turned into a new carbon tax \u2014 one [that is] three times higher than that implemented by Julia Gillard,\" he said.\n\nAt the time the safeguard mechanism changes were made, they were largely backed by business and industry groups who sought certainty for climate policies affecting their sectors.\n\nMany of those groups argue that while there is room to adjust the scheme, it needs to stay.\n\nCertainty critical\n\nIndustry groups rarely clamour for more government regulation, but climate policy was at one point something of an exception.\n\nGroups like the Business Council of Australia complained of \"a decade of ad hoc and unstable energy and climate policy\" that had left the country on the \"back foot\" in achieving climate targets.\n\nOthers that did push back did so reasonably gently \u2014 the Minerals Council of Australia warned the country needed to 'thread the needle' and push down emissions, without pushing projects out of business.\n\nNow that the policy is in place, some are arguing it is worth keeping.\n\nAndrew McKellar from the Australian Chamber of Commerce and Industry says policy stability is critical for business.\n\nAndrew McKellar has urged stability with the safeguard mechanism after years of tumult on climate policy.

{"title":"A carbon tax can have economic, not just environmental benefits for Australia","author":"Mona Mashhadi Rajabi","content":"A new study has found that a carbon tax, accompanied by \u201crevenue recycling\u201d, can produce both environmental and economic benefits for Australia. \n\nRevenue recycling means money reaped from a carbon tax would be redirected back into the economy. This means the money accumulated from the tax would be redistributed between different stakeholders in the economy without increasing the government\u2019s revenue.\n\nTo be more specific, the tax income should be used to support consumption, invest in new research and development projects, and subsidise energy saving and pollution reducing programs. Using this approach makes the tax more politically appealing to companies and other opponents.\n\nAustralia\u2019s experience with a carbon tax \nDebate about a carbon tax has always been heated in Australia. The Gillard government introduced a carbon pricing scheme in 2012 which involved an initial rate of $23 per tonne on about 500 big carbon emitters, including the electricity industry.\n\nThe scheme contained compensation measures including increases in money to government payment recipients and a program to help emissions-intensive, trade-exposed industries reduce carbon emissions, which were themselves a form of recycling.\n\nDespite reducing emissions, the tax only lasted two years before it was terminated by the Abbott government, which argued the tax was costing big companies and causing electricity prices to rise.\n\nI examined how such a scheme could work again, basing the design on the models used in Norway, Ireland and Switzerland. I simulated Australia\u2019s economy from 2020 to 2035 to examine the impact of a carbon tax policy with the associated revenue recycling approach on prices, total emissions and economic growth.\n\nThe first step in the design is identifying a tax rate and the reach of the policy. Research shows that a uniform rate covering the whole industry sector generates the greatest environmental benefits.\n\nAs well as suggesting a uniform tax rate on all sectors including the electricity sector (which is excluded from the current emissions safeguard mechanism), my study recommends starting the tax rate at $23 (the same rate applied in Gillard\u2019s scheme) in 2023 and increasing it gradually to $70 in 2030.\n\nThe rate would stay at this level until 2035.\n\nA carbon tax increases the cost of production and leads to an increase in the inflation rate. The inflation impact of this policy is estimated to be 0.5% in 2023, increasing substantially to 1.52% in 2035.\n\nRising inflation reduces the spending power of families and reduces consumption and economic growth. Considering consumption has a fundamental role in a growing economy, the accumulated tax revenue would be used to keep consumption unchanged after implementing a carbon tax.\n\nHow a new version of the tax would work \nMy study recommends using the accumulated carbon tax revenue to lower income taxes. This would leave more money for families, thereby reducing the impact of inflation, caused by the tax, on the economy.\n\nAs well as strengthening families\u2019 spending power, a share of the tax revenue would be invested in research and development projects. This would create new jobs and provide a baseline for a prosperous economy.\n\nMy study recommends that in the first year, all the tax revenue would be used to support consumption. However, the amount of money allotted to investment would rise from the second year as the carbon tax rate increases. It is estimated that about $57 billion would be available for new technologies over 13 years under this carbon tax.\n\nImposing a carbon tax would also provide a financial incentive for industry to reduce its fossil fuel use. It would motivate the sector to shift to low-carbon technologies as they would bear a smaller tax bill and reap larger profits.\n\nMy study concludes Australia could reduce carbon emissions by 35% while GDP would increase by 0.286% by 2035 and new jobs would be created in research and development. Following the recommended carbon tax design, Australia\u2019s transition to a low-carbon economy would be accelerated, which would benefit both the economy and the environment.","issue":"australia-carbon-tax","url":"https:\/\/theconversation.com\/a-carbon-tax-can-have-economic-not-just-environmental-benefits-for-australia-210380","sources":[{"Name":"Unspecified Study","Biography":"An unnamed recent study conducted on the economic and environmental impact of carbon tax policy in Australia","Information":"The study finds that implementing a carbon tax, with a focus on 'revenue recycling,' can offer environmental and economic benefits for Australia.

By modeling Australia\u2019s economy from 2020 to 2035 and comparing it to the carbon tax schemes used in Norway, Ireland, and Switzerland, it was determined that starting the carbon tax rate at AUD 23 per tonne and increasing it to AUD 70 by 2030 could produce substantial benefits, including a projected reduction of carbon emissions by 35% and an increase in GDP by 0.286% by 2035."},{"Name":"Unnamed Author of the Article","Biography":"The author of the news article discussing the proposed carbon tax policies in Australia","Information":"The author explains the history and debate surrounding carbon tax policies in Australia, referencing the Gillard government's 2012 carbon pricing scheme set at AUD 23 per tonne, which included compensation measures to mitigate its impact on the economy, before its termination under the Abbott government due to claims of rising costs for big companies and increased electricity prices.

{"title":"Trump and Elon Musk trade insults and accusations as public feud reaches new heights","author":"Kathryn Watson","content":"Washington \u2014 The relationship between President Trump and Elon Musk broke down in dramatic and public fashion on Thursday, with the president threatening to cancel Musk's lucrative government contracts and Musk claiming that Mr. Trump could not have won the presidency without him, fueling a feud that erupted over Musk's opposition to Republicans' tax and budget bill.\n\nIn the afternoon, Musk dropped what he called \"the really big bomb,\" alleging that Mr. Trump's name appeared in the files related to the case of Jeffrey Epstein, the disgraced financier who died by suicide in federal custody in 2019 while facing charges of sex trafficking. \"@realDonaldTrump is in the Epstein files. That is the real reason they have not been made public,\" Musk wrote on X. \"Have a nice day, DJT!\"\n\nTrump officials vowed to unveil more files related to the Epstein case when the administration took power. In February, the Justice Department issued a limited release of unredacted versions of files that had been public for years, a move that was met with criticism by conservatives who have demanded more transparency.\n\nMr. Trump soon responded with another post of his own: \"I don't mind Elon turning against me, but he should have done so months ago. This is one of the Greatest Bills ever presented to Congress.\"\n\nMusk also expressed support for a post that said Mr. Trump should be impeached and replaced by Vice President JD Vance.\n\nThe break between the president and the world's richest man originated over Musk's ongoing criticism of Republicans' \"big, beautiful bill\" on Capitol Hill, which cuts taxes by trillions of dollars and implements Mr. Trump's domestic agenda, including cutting hundreds of billions of dollars in spending. Musk has railed against the legislation as \"outrageous\" and \"a disgusting abomination.\" The Congressional Budget Office estimated on Wednesday that the bill would lead to an increase of $2.4 trillion in total deficits over the next 10 years, a conclusion that Republicans and Mr. Trump dispute.\n\n\"This is an unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted,\" White House press secretary Karoline Leavitt said in a statement Thursday evening. \"The President is focused on passing this historic piece of legislation and making our country great again.\"\n\n\"I'm very disappointed in Elon\"\nThe president was asked about Musk's criticism for the first time publicly during a meeting with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office earlier Thursday.\n\n\"Elon and I had a great relationship,\" Mr. Trump told reporters. \"I don't know if we will anymore.\"\n\nMr. Trump said Musk, the CEO of Tesla, was around for the whole process of crafting the bill. The president claimed he \"never had a problem\" with the legislation until provisions dealing with electric vehicle subsidies were eliminated, threatening Tesla's business. The bill would roll back some of the clean energy tax credits under the Biden-era climate and health care law, phasing out a tax break for clean energy vehicles.\n\n\"I'm very disappointed in Elon. I've helped Elon a lot,\" Mr. Trump told reporters, adding that Musk \"worked hard\" and did a \"good job.\"\n\n\"And I'll be honest, I think he misses the place,\" the president continued. \"He's not the first. People leave my administration and they love us. And then, at some point, they miss it so badly. And some of them embrace it and some of them actually become hostile. I don't know what it is. It's sort of Trump derangement syndrome, I guess they call it.\"\n\n\"Without me, Trump would have lost the election\"... \"Such ingratitude\"\nAppearing to respond to Mr. Trump's comments in real time, Musk wrote on X: \"Whatever. Keep the EV\/solar incentive cuts in the bill, even though no oil & gas subsidies are touched (very unfair!!), but ditch the MOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK in the bill.\" In another post, he denied that he was aware of the details in the bill when it was crafted, writing that \"this bill was never shown to me even once and was passed in the dead of night so fast that almost no one in Congress could even read it!\"\n\n\"Without me, Trump would have lost the election, Dems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\" Musk went on. \"Such ingratitude,\" he added.\n\nMusk spent roughly $277 million to elect Mr. Trump and Republican lawmakers last year.\n\n\"Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave\"\nMr. Trump volleyed back with attacks on Truth Social, claiming that he asked Musk to leave his administration and upset him with the legislative proposal ending the tax credits for electric vehicles.\n\n\"Elon was 'wearing thin,' I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!\" the president wrote.\n\nThreats to \"terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts\"\nThe president also threatened to cancel Musk's federal contracts, citing such a move as a cost-cutting measure.\n\n\"The easiest way to save money in our Budget, Billions and Billions of Dollars, is to terminate Elon's Governmental Subsidies and Contracts. I was always surprised that Biden didn't do it!\" Mr. Trump said.\n\nSpaceX and Tesla get billions of dollars a year from federal contracts and other programs. Shares of Tesla plummeted following Mr. Trump's threat, dropping by as much as 18% in late trading.\n\nMusk responded with a threat of his own, posting on X: \"In light of the President's statement about cancellation of my government contracts, @SpaceX will begin decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft immediately.\" NASA relies on SpaceX's Crew Dragon to ferry astronauts to the International Space Station. But Musk followed that comment a few hours later with another post saying, \"Good advice. Ok, we won't decommission Dragon.\"\n\nVice President JD Vance, meanwhile, expressed support for Mr. Trump, saying on X late Thursday he is \"proud to stand beside him\" in a post that did not name Musk.\n\nThe president's comments expressing disappointment with Musk were a swift about-face. Less than a week ago, Mr. Trump gifted Musk a key to the White House as an expression of gratitude for his work with the White House's Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE. Musk wrapped up his time in the federal government Friday, as he reached the maximum amount of days he could serve as a special government employee.\n\nMr. Trump said then that Musk was \"really not leaving. He's going to be back and forth, I think, I have a feeling.\"\n\nMusk's opposition has raised questions about whether Republicans can remain united around the centerpiece legislation of Mr. Trump's second-term agenda, but GOP leaders in Congress appeared undeterred Wednesday, as the Senate forged ahead on the legislation. Musk and House Speaker Mike Johnson are expected to speak Thursday about the bill's path forward.\n\nMeeting with German chancellor takes a turn\nMr. Trump's comments about Musk came as Merz and the president met to discuss trade and tariffs, as well as Russia's war in Ukraine and tensions in the Middle East. But the part of the meeting that was open to the press was dominated by the questions about Musk.\n\n\"It's an honor to have you,\" Mr. Trump told the German leader, calling him a challenging negotiator but adding that he's a great representative for Germany.\n\nIt was their first in-person meeting since Merz, leader of Germany's center-right Christian Democratic Union party, won a parliamentary vote to become chancellor last month following an election in February.\n\nMerz brought a gift for Mr. Trump to the White House \u2014 an original copy of the birth certificate belonging to Mr. Trump's grandfather, Friedrich Trump, in German and in English.\n\nMr. Trump's 50% tariffs on imports from the European Union are set to take effect July 9. The EU, which includes Germany, has said it's preparing \"countermeasures\" to hit back. The 50% tariffs were set to start June 1, but Mr. Trump delayed the heavy tariffs after speaking with European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen. Twenty-seven nations make up the EU.\n\nThe Trump-Merz meeting also comes hours after the president signed a proclamation Wednesday banning foreign nationals from a dozen countries, including Afghanistan and Haiti.\n\nEarlier in the day, Mr. Trump said he spoke with Chinese President Xi Jinping about tariffs and trade for roughly 90 minutes Thursday morning. The president told reporters in the Oval Office Thursday that he's accepted Xi's invitation to visit China, and will go there with first lady Melania Trump \"at a certain point.\"","issue":"musk-trump-feud","url":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/trump-german-chancellor-merz-meeting-white-house-today-2025-06-05\/","sources":[{"Name":"President Donald Trump","Biography":"The 45th President of the United States serving his term as a Republican leader.","Information":"President Donald Trump responded to Elon Musk's public opposition to the Republican tax and budget bill, expressing disappointment in Musk's stance.

{"title":"Elon Musk\u2013Donald Trump Feud","author":"Various Wikipedia contributors","content":"Since June 2025, the businessman and former presidential advisor Elon Musk and U.S. president Donald Trump have been involved in a feud, primarily across Twitter and Truth Social. The dispute began following Musk's exit from Trump's administration with his criticisms of the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, a bill intended to be landmark legislation for Trump.[1]\n\n**Background**\n\n**Musk and the second Trump administration**\n\nIn the 2024 United States presidential election, Elon Musk contributed over US$250 million to Donald Trump's presidential campaign.[2] In the Trump administration, Musk led the Department of Government Efficiency in an effort to dramatically restructure the federal bureaucracy.[3] He served as a special government employee, limiting his tenure to 130 days.[4]\n\nMusk played a prominent role in campaigning during the 2025 Wisconsin Supreme Court election, spending at least US$23 million through political action committees. His role in the election was a political liability for Brad Schimel.[5] At the Qatar Economic Forum in May 2025, Musk said that he would scale back political spending.[6] Musk told investors in Tesla that he would devote greater attention to his companies in April.[7] The following month, Musk left the Trump administration in a farewell ceremony.[8] Immediately after reporters left the Oval Office, Trump confronted Musk over political donations made to Democrats by Jared Isaacman, a Musk ally who was Trump's nominee administrator of NASA. Trump informed Isaacman hours later that his nomination was being withdrawn.[9]\n\n**Musk's criticisms**\n\nAfter the One Big Beautiful Bill Act, drafted by Trump and the Republican Party, passed the House of Representatives, Musk criticized it for increasing the deficit by US$1.5 trillion. Notably, he initially refrained from criticizing Trump himself.[8] In June, Musk told CBS News Sunday Morning that the bill would reverse the Department of Government Efficiency's work.[10]\n\n**Events**\n\nOn June 5, 2025, Trump met with German chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office. During the meeting, Trump stated that he \"had a great relationship\" with Musk,[11] that he was \"disappointed\" in Musk for criticizing the One Big Beautiful Bill Act,[12] that he would have won the state of Pennsylvania in the 2024 presidential election without Musk and that he was critical of the bill over its cuts to electric vehicle subsidies rather than the national debt it would incur,[13] and that Musk missed being in the White House, comparing him to former aides who became critical of Trump after leaving his administration.[14]\n\nIn response to Trump's comment that Musk \"knew the inner workings of the bill better than anybody\" in the room, Musk said on the social media site X that he did not have the opportunity to read the bill.[15] Musk, responding to Trump in real-time,[15] said that Trump had \"ingratitude\" and would have lost the election if not for his political activities.[8] Musk's posts included pointing out old posts from Trump chastising increases to the national debt, mockingly suggesting in one post that Trump was replaced by a \"body double\".[16] He rejected Trump's claim that he began criticizing the bill after efforts to remove cuts for electric vehicle subsidies failed.[17] Musk suggested that Trump was in the \"Epstein files\", the United States government's information on the convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.[18]\n\nAccording to The New York Times, Musk unfollowed the X accounts of Stephen Miller, Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy and his homeland security advisor, as well as Charlie Kirk, a conservative influencer; the two men appeared on Kirk's show to praise the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.[19] Hours later, Trump wrote on Truth Social that Musk went \"CRAZY\" after the \"EV Mandate\" was purportedly taken away.[20] He then threatened to cut Musk's government contracts.[21] That evening, Musk called for Trump's impeachment.[22]\n\nThat night, Politico reported that Musk and Trump were scheduled to be on a call to reconcile. Responding to the hedge fund manager Bill Ackman's plea for the men to \"make peace for the benefit of our great country\", Musk said that he was \"not wrong.\"[23] The following day, the White House stated that no call was planned.[24] The White House later said that Trump was selling the red Tesla Model S he received from Musk.[25] Trump told ABC News that Musk had \"lost his mind\" and that he was not interested in speaking to Musk,[26] and repeating in a CNN interview he won\u2019t be speaking to him in the near future.[27] According to Bloomberg News, Trump aides signaled that Trump was moving on and that he would not cancel Musk's government contracts.[28] The New York Times later reported that Trump attributed Musk's apparent \"crazy\" behavior to his alleged drug use.[29]\n\n**Effects**\n\n**Political**\n\nIn one post, Musk suggested creating a political party to represent the \"eighty percent in the middle\".[30] The New York Times wrote that the feud poses implications for the \"Tech Right\", a group of conservative entrepreneurs, including individuals who work for Trump,[31] as well as risking US$100 million in political donations to Trump-affiliated organizations that Musk was set to give.[32] The proposed name for the party by Musk himself was \"The America Party\".[33]\n\nMusk suggested that he would affect the electoral standing of lawmakers who did not support him in a post on Twitter.[34] The dispute did not appear to affect the One Big Beautiful Bill Act.[35]\n\n**Economic**\n\nShares in Tesla, Inc. fell fifteen percent, its worst day since the COVID-19 pandemic.[36] Trading volumes for Tesla put options exceeded four million contracts, the highest on record.[37] Accoring to S3 Partners, short sellers accrued a cumulative US$4 billion; Tesla became the second-most shorted stock in the U.S. by total value.[38] The fall in Tesla's share price brought consumer discretionary stocks to their worst day since April.[39] Trump Media & Technology Group shares fell eight percent after Musk insinuated that Trump was in the Epstein files.[40] Trump's cryptocurrency, $TRUMP, additionally fell twelve percent.[41] The feud cost Musk US$34 billion.[42]\n\nAccording to The Wall Street Journal, the feud raised hopes from advertisers that litigation against companies that have refused to advertise on X would be eased, owing to lessened political weight.[43] The dispute threatened a US$5 billion debt sale for Musk's xAI.[44]\n\n**Government**\n\nSteve Bannon, a former advisor to Trump, said that he was urging Trump to cancel government contracts with his companies and to investigate Musk's immigration status, his alleged drug use, and his apparent efforts to attend a classified briefing on a possible war between China and Taiwan.[45] After Bannon called for Trump to seize SpaceX with an executive order, Musk referred to him as a \"communist retard\".[46] Democratic representatives Stephen Lynch and Robert Garcia sent a letter to attorney general Pam Bondi and Federal Bureau of Investigation director Kash Patel inquiring about Musk's allegation that Trump was present in government files on Epstein.[47]\n\nOn X, Musk stated that SpaceX was decommissioning its Dragon spacecraft, necessary to the operations of the International Space Station.[22] He backed down a few hours later.[48]\n\n**Responses**\n\n**Domestic**\n\nOn social media, comparisons between the feud and that in Mean Girls (2004), as well as the Drake\u2013Kendrick Lamar feud, were made. The livestreamer Hasan Piker said that Musk should \"pull up\" to his podcast to infuriate Trump.[49]\n\nThe dissolution of Musk and Trump's relationship was praised by some Make America Great Again followers.[50] A YouGov survey indicated that most Republicans support Trump in the feud, while most Democrats were neutral.[51]\n\nSenate minority leader Chuck Schumer referenced \"Bad Blood\", a song by Taylor Swift believed to be about her feud with Katy Perry. House minority leader Hakeem Jeffries referred to the feud as a \"GOP civil war\". The Democratic Party's X account called to \"KILL THE BILL AND RELEASE THE EPSTEIN FILES!\"[52] On War Room, Steve Bannon warned that Musk could be \"flipped\" by Democrats.[53] Representative Ro Khanna argued that Democrats should court Musk.[54]\n\n**International**\n\nRussian internet users compared the feud to the Wagner Group\u2013Russian Ministry of Defence conflict, a dispute between Russia's Ministry of Defence and the oligarch Yevgeny Prigozhin that led to the Wagner Group rebellion. Dmitry Medvedev, the deputy chairman of the Security Council, joked that he was willing to broker a truce between Musk and Trump.[55]\n\nTrump's focus on Musk during his meeting with Friedrich Merz was met with relief from several German commentators, who noted caustic meetings with Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky and South African president Cyril Ramaphosa.[56]","issue":"musk-trump-feud","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Elon_Musk%E2%80%93Donald_Trump_feud","sources":[{"Name":"The New York Times","Biography":"A major American newspaper known for its comprehensive coverage of political and international events.","Information":"The New York Times reported that Elon Musk unfollowed the X accounts of Stephen Miller, who was Donald Trump's deputy chief of staff for policy and his homeland security advisor, and Charlie Kirk, a conservative influencer.

The share price fell more than 14 percent, lopping off more than $150 billion from Tesla\u2019s market value \u2014 and, according to Bloomberg, tanking Musk\u2019s personal net worth by $34 billion.\n\nThe core of the argument between the two men \u2014 whether the Republican spending package is a \u201cbig, beautiful bill\u201d or a \u201cMOUNTAIN of DISGUSTING PORK\u201d \u2014 is a side concern for people whose main priority is Tesla.\n\n\u201cThe CEO of that company needs to spend his time focused on the company\u2019s success,\u201d said Nick Nigro, the head of Atlas Public Policy, which analyzes the electric vehicle market. \u201cWhether his interest in federal policy comes from a good place, it\u2019s a distraction from what Tesla shareholders and drivers need, which is his full attention.\u201d\n\nSeth Abramson, a vociferous Musk critic who is writing a book about the entrepreneur, wrote on X that \u201cMusk will go the rest of his life without a political home or patron, shunned by politicians of both parties and therefore unable to effectively operate as a CEO of any company.\u201d\n\nThe breakup between the world\u2019s richest man and one of its most powerful could have far-reaching impacts for Musk\u2019s companies.\n\nInvestor optimism about Tesla has been based on the assumption that Musk\u2019s proximity to power would lead to a national policy on autonomous vehicles that would ease the arrival of Tesla\u2019s robotaxi, which is supposed to hit the roads of Austin, Texas, this month. Musk could also lose leverage on other issues important to Tesla, such as Trump\u2019s tariffs on China\u2019s critical minerals. Meanwhile, his space company SpaceX has billions of dollars of federal defense and space contracts \u2014 now at risk \u2014 while its satellite subsidiary Starlink is angling for billions more in federal broadband subsidies.\n\n\u2018Attack mode\u2019\n\nTesla is still the country\u2019s largest electric automaker. But the Trump-Musk split comes at a vulnerable moment for both Tesla and electric vehicles writ large.\n\nThe company is facing declining sales around the world, as its vehicle lineup has grown stale and Musk\u2019s political activities have turned off many EV buyers in Europe and North America.\n\nMeanwhile, federal support for EVs is hanging by a thread. The House\u2019s version of the megabill would drastically scale back Biden-era tax incentives meant to stimulate EV manufacturing and sales.\n\nThe fight between Trump and Musk escalated on Thursday after Trump told reporters that Musk was \u201cupset\u201d about the House-passed bill\u2019s proposal to remove EV tax credits and other incentives. Musk took to X to deny that narrative, writing: \u201cKeep the EV\/solar incentives cuts in the bill, also cut all the crazy spending increases in the Big Ugly Bill so that America doesn\u2019t go bankrupt!\u201d\n\nThe president\u2019s repeated attacks on EVs and vows to repeal the Biden administration\u2019s subsidies certainly didn\u2019t seem to trouble Musk much during last year\u2019s campaign, when the megabillionaire spent more than $270 million and countless hours to help put Trump back into the White House. (Trump did concede at the time that Tesla made a \u201cgreat product.\u201d)\n\nMusk\u2019s apparent willingness to sacrifice federal incentives was unwelcome news to clean energy and EV advocates who hope Republican senators will save some of the tax credits from the Democrats\u2019 2022 climate law. Republicans can afford to lose only three votes in the Senate, and some GOP senators have indicated they think the bill\u2019s rollbacks go too far.\n\nThe war of words between Trump and Musk ended any hopes that the Tesla CEO would have the leverage with the White House to tip the scales.\n\n\u201cElon was \u2018wearing thin,\u2019 I asked him to leave, I took away his EV Mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted (that he knew for months I was going to do!), and he just went CRAZY!\u201d Trump posted on his social media site, Truth Social.\n\nThat statement was a far cry from three months ago, when Trump made a show of buying a Tesla in front of the White House. That gesture raised hopes among some Tesla shareholders that Republicans would embrace Tesla and compensate for its diminished popularity among Democrats, many of whom had taken to staging protests outside its showrooms.\n\n\u201cI\u2019m going to buy because No. 1, it\u2019s a great product, as good as it gets. And No. 2, because this man has devoted his energy and his life to doing this, I think he\u2019s been treated very unfairly by a very small group of people,\u201d Trump said at the time about Musk.\n\nNow, that\u2019s all changed.\n\n\u201cTrump no longer has to say nice things about Tesla and EVs,\u201d said Loren McDonald, an analyst at the EV data shop Paren, in a message. \u201cHe and the admin can go back to \u2018EVs are evil\u2019 attack mode.\u201d\n\nCritical minerals and beyond\n\nThe fizzled bromance could also alter the myriad and complex relationships that Tesla has across the globe, as well as its business before the federal government.\n\nMusk, for example, will presumably hold no sway over the administration\u2019s intended move to impose steep tariffs on imports of Chinese graphite used to make EV batteries.\n\nThe Commerce Department concluded last month that imported Chinese graphite is receiving unfair subsidies. The agency laid out a plan to impose tariffs of up to 721 percent on some natural and artificial graphite active anode material from China that\u2019s used in batteries.\n\nTesla has fought against the tariffs, with one of the company\u2019s attorneys pointing out that U.S. manufacturers don\u2019t yet produce anode material that meets carmakers\u2019 standards.\n\nThe fallout could also put a bulls-eye on Musk\u2019s financial ties to Beijing, something Democrats have repeatedly railed against.\n\nThe Trump administration and lawmakers from both parties are pushing to ease China\u2019s grip on supply chains, from the production of critical minerals to processing and manufacturing of EV batteries.\n\nYet Tesla has many ties to China, including reliance on graphite imports, a gigafactory located in Shanghai, and ongoing work with Contemporary Amperex Technology Ltd. CATL, the world\u2019s largest battery-maker, is on a U.S. government list of companies that work with the Chinese military.\n\nIn short, nothing on Thursday boded well for America\u2019s leading electric automaker.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s another Twilight Zone moment in this Musk\/Trump relationship which now is quickly moving downhill,\u201d wrote Dan Ives, an analyst at investment shop Wedbush Securities who tracks Tesla.\n\nBut Ives nonetheless remained hopeful.

{"title":"From bros to foes: how the unlikely Trump-Musk relationship imploded","author":"Nandita Bose and Jeff Mason","content":"When Donald Trump met privately with White House officials on Wednesday, there was little to suggest that the U.S. president was close to a public break with Elon Musk, the billionaire businessman who helped him win a second term in office. Two White House officials familiar with the matter said Trump expressed confusion and frustration in the meeting about Musk's attacks on his sweeping tax and spending bill. But he held back, the officials said, because he wanted to preserve Musk's political and financial support ahead of the 2026 midterm election. \n\nBy Thursday afternoon, Trump's mood had shifted. He had not spoken to Musk since the attacks began and was fuming over what one White House aide described as a \"completely batshit\" tirade by the Tesla CEO on X, his social media platform. On Friday, a White House official said Trump was not interested in talking to Musk and no phone call between the two men was planned for the day. Musk had blasted Trump's tax bill as fiscally reckless and a \"disgusting abomination.\" He vowed to oppose any Republican lawmaker who supported it. The bill would fulfill many of Trump's priorities while adding, according to the Congressional Budget Office, $2.4 trillion to the $36.2-trillion U.S. public debt.\n\nPrivately, Trump had called Musk volatile. On Thursday, he told his team, it was time to take the gloves off. Sitting next to German Chancellor Friedrich Merz in the Oval Office, Trump told reporters he was \"very disappointed\" in his former adviser. Musk quickly hit back on social media, and the back-and-forth devolved from there. \"The easiest way to save money in our budget, billions and billions of dollars, is to terminate Elon's government subsidies and contracts,\" Trump posted on Truth Social, his social media site. Within minutes, Musk said it might be time to create a new political party and endorsed a post on X from Ian Miles Cheong, a prominent Musk supporter and right-wing activist, calling for Trump's impeachment.\n\nThe depth of the Trump-Musk relationship at its height was unprecedented in Washington - a sitting president granting a billionaire tech CEO access and influence inside the White House and throughout his government. Musk spent nearly $300 million backing Trump's campaign and other Republicans last year. For months, Musk played both insider and disruptor - shaping policy conversations behind the scenes, amplifying Trump's agenda to millions online, and attacking the bureaucracy and federal spending through his self-styled Department of Government Efficiency. Just last week, Trump hosted a farewell for Musk and declared that \"Elon is really not leaving.\" Now he had not only left but had turned into a top critic. Hours after Trump's Oval Office remarks, a third White House official expressed surprise at Musk's turnaround. It \"caught the president and the entire West Wing off guard,\" she said. Musk did not respond to emails seeking comment about the downturn in relations. His super PAC spending group, America PAC, and spokeswoman Katie Miller did not respond to calls and texts requesting comment.\n\nIn a statement, the White House called the breakup an \"unfortunate episode from Elon, who is unhappy with the One Big Beautiful Bill because it does not include the policies he wanted.\" The Musk-Trump breakup sent Tesla's stock price plunging 14% on Thursday and drove uncertainty among Trump's allies in Congress, who are working to pass the monumental spending package that Democrats and a small number of vocal Republicans oppose. Tesla shares clawed back from steep losses on Friday. \n\nThe breakup could reshape both men's futures. For Trump, losing Musk's backing threatens his growing influence among tech donors, social media audiences, and younger male voters \u2014 key groups that may now be harder to reach. It could also complicate fundraising ahead of next year's midterm elections. For Musk, the stakes are potentially even higher. The break risks intensified scrutiny of his business practices that could jeopardize government contracts and invite regulatory probes, which might threaten his companies' profits. Some of Musk's friends and associates were stunned by the fallout, with a number of them only recently expressing confidence that the partnership would endure, according to two other sources familiar with the dynamics. The split had been simmering for weeks, said the first two White House officials, but the breaking point was over personnel: Trump's decision to pull his nomination of Jared Isaacman, Musk's hand-picked candidate to be NASA administrator. \"He was not happy\" about Isaacman, one of the White House officials said of Musk.\n\nIsaacman, a billionaire entrepreneur and close Musk ally, was seen as key to advancing Musk's vision for space exploration and commercial space ventures. After his nomination was scuttled, Isaacman posted on X: \"I am incredibly grateful to President Trump, the Senate and all those who supported me.\" The move was viewed within the administration as a direct snub to Musk, the two officials said, signaling a loss of political clout and deepening the rift between him and Trump's team. Before the Isaacman episode, top White House aides behind the scenes had already begun limiting Musk's influence \u2014 quietly walking back his authority over staffing and budget decisions. Trump himself reinforced that message in early March, telling his cabinet that department secretaries, not Musk, had the final say over agency operations. At the same time, Musk began to hint that his time in government would come to a close, while expressing frustration at times that he could not more aggressively cut spending. \n\nHis threats and complaints about Trump's bill grew louder, but inside the White House, few believed they would seriously alter the course of the legislation \u2014 even as some worried about the fallout on the midterms from Musk's warnings to cut political spending, the first two White House officials said. Still, a fourth White House official dismissed the impact of Musk's words on the president's signature bill. \"We're very confident,\" he said. \"No one has changed their minds.\" But there was bafflement at the White House at how a relationship that only last week had been celebrated in the Oval Office had taken such a turn. Time will tell whether the rift can be repaired.","issue":"musk-trump-feud","url":"https:\/\/www.reuters.com\/world\/us\/bros-foes-how-unlikely-trump-musk-relationship-imploded-2025-06-06\/","sources":[{"Name":"Two White House officials","Biography":"Anonymous officials from the Trump administration during his presidency, familiar with internal discussions.","Information":"These officials reported that Donald Trump expressed confusion and frustration over Elon Musk's public criticism of Trump's tax and spending bill during a private meeting on Wednesday.

{"title":"Trump and Musk Split","author":"Spencer Neale","content":"The relationship between President Donald Trump and Tesla CEO Elon Musk collapsed in spectacular fashion on Thursday. \n\nAs Trump met with the Chancellor of Germany Friedrich Merz at the White House Thursday afternoon, Musk posted a battery of tweets to his social media platform X criticizing Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Beautiful\u201d spending bill.\n\n\u201cThe Big Ugly Bill will INCREASE the deficit to $2.5 trillion!\u201d warned Musk. \n\n\u201cIn the entire history of civilization, there has never been legislation that both big and beautiful,\u201d read another missive. \u201cEither you get a big and ugly bill or a slim and beautiful bill.

The 47th president said on Wednesday that he was \u201cvery pleased to announce\u201d that he agrees with longtime Democratic rival Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has called for the debt ceiling to be scrapped. \u201cWise words,\u201d Musk replied sarcastically to Trump\u2019s 2013 post.\n\nMusk escalated his rhetoric as Trump finished his meeting with Merz. Musk said Trump was guilty of \u201cingratitude\u201d and suggested the 47th president could not have won the 2024 election without his financial assistance. \u201cDems would control the House and the Republicans would be 51-49 in the Senate,\u201d wrote Musk. The DOGE man then created a poll which asked X users if he should form \u201ca new political party in America that actually represents the 80% in the middle?\u201d The poll received more than 3 million votes by Thursday evening with more than 80% of respondents voting in support of Musk\u2019s idea. \n\nResponding on Truth Social, Trump said he \u201casked Musk to leave\u201d his administration because the tech titan was \u201cwearing thin.\u201d Trump added, \u201cI took away his EV mandate that forced everyone to buy Electric Cars that nobody else wanted\u2026 and he just went CRAZY!\u201d \n\nThe president wasn\u2019t finished. In a separate post to Truth, Trump threatened Musk\u2019s business by suggesting the \u201ceasiest way to save money on the Budget\u201d is \u201cto terminate Elon\u2019s Governmental Subsidies and Contracts.\u201d\n\nThe stock price of Tesla collapsed following the threat, finishing almost 15 percent down on the day and erasing more than $150 billion in market cap from the carmaker, marking the company\u2019s biggest daily loss in history.

{"title":"Panda diplomacy","author":"Wikipedia contributors","content":"Panda diplomacy (Chinese: \u718a\u732b\u5916\u4ea4) is the practice of sending giant pandas from China to other countries as a tool of diplomacy and wildlife conservation.[1] From 1941 to 1984, the Chinese government gifted pandas to other countries. Since 1984, they have been leased rather than gifted due to a PRC policy change.  \n\nHistory  \n**Pre-1950s**  \nWhile there are few ancient records of the giant panda, \"During the Manchu dynasty skins of this animal [bei-shung, presumed to be the panda] were sent as tribute to the government of China by the aborigines of western Szechuan and eastern Tibet\", according to David Crockett Graham.[2]:\u200a25\u200a[3]:\u200a19\u200a. \n\nThe first instance of panda diplomacy in the modern era was arranged by Soong Mei-ling (Madame Chiang) in 1941. China was under siege by Japan, the U.S. had been sending aid to the Kuomintang (Nationalist Government) in China, and Madame Chiang wanted a dramatic way of saying thank you. There had been previous pandas sent to the U.S., including one named Su Lin sold to the Brookfield Zoo in Chicago by Ruth Harkness in 1937, a second one named Mei-Mei brought back by Harkness in 1938 and also sold to the Brookfield Zoo,[4] one named Pandora sent to the Bronx Zoo by David Crockett Graham in 1938, and a second named Pan sent to the Bronx Zoo in 1939.[2]:\u200a92\u200a. \n\n\nPost-1950s \nWhile the Republic of China used giant pandas for diplomatic means as early as 1941,[10] The People's Republic of China began to use panda diplomacy more prominently in the 1950s and has continued the practice into the present day. Between 1957 and 1983, 24 pandas were given as gifts to 9 nations as gestures of friendship. These nations included the Soviet Union, the Democratic People's Republic of Korea, the United States of America, and the United Kingdom.[11]  \nChina presented two pandas to the Los Angeles during the 1984 Olympic Games for $50,000 per month per panda. This practice was again modified in 1991 in favour of long-term leases.[18] \n\n**Taiwan**  \nMain article: Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan  \nIn 2005, Lien Chan, Chairman of the Kuomintang, the then opposition party in Taiwan, visited mainland China. As part of the talks between Lien and the CCP, two pandas (later named Tuan Tuan and Yuan Yuan, meaning \"reunion\" in Chinese) were offered as a gift to the people of Taiwan. The gift of pandas was seen as an attempt by the CCP to draw the ROC government into its \"united front\". Several zoos in Taiwan made bids to host the pandas, the ROC government raised objections, ostensibly because pandas were not suited to the Taiwanese climate.  \n\n**United States**  \nIn the 1970s, the Nixon administration sought to improve US-China relations. Shortly after Nixon visited China in 1972, Beijing sent two pandas, named Ling-Ling and Hsing-Hsing. In February 2024, the China Wildlife Conservation Association announced plans to send a new pair of pandas to the San Diego Zoo as early as summer 2024, nearly five years after the Zoo returned its pandas to China.[36][37]  \n\n**Other Nations**  \nOther countries recognize the significance of pandas as diplomatic symbols, emblematic of the state of relations with China. These pandas include a two-year-old male Ru Yi and a one-year-old female Ding Ding.[50] In December 2023, the only giant pandas in the UK were sent back to China.[51]  \n\n**Practicalities**  \nKeeping pandas is very expensive. Besides the \"rent\" payable to China, obtaining enough bamboo is very expensive. During the COVID-19 pandemic, the supply of bamboo added to cost considerations.  \n\n**Citations**  \n1.  ^ Panda Diplomacy: [1] \n2.  ^  David Crockett Graham: [2]:\u200a25 \n3.  ^ David Crockett Graham: [3]:\u200a19 \n4.  ^ Details of Madame Chiang: [4] \n5.  ^ Smithsonian Skins: [5]:\u200a55  \n6.  ^ William J.

{"title":"Peaceful pawprints on a complex diplomatic relationship","author":"Phaedra Trethan","content":"Diplomatic relations between the U.S. and China have had their ups and downs. The one (relatively) consistent sign of goodwill between the countries? The pandas.\n\nPandas, those roly-poly, black-and-white stuffies come to life, are back in the United States and already delighting visitors to the Smithsonian's National Zoo as they frolic in the snow, gnaw on bamboo and generally add a bit of whimsy and joy to an otherwise frigid and foreboding January.\n\nThree-year-old Bao Li (a male) and Qing Bao (a female) made their public debut at the zoo on Friday, months after their October arrival in Washington, D.C. from their home in Chengdu in the Sichuan province of China. They replaced Mei Xiang, Tian Tian, and their cub, Xiao Qi Ji, who returned to China when their lease expired in November 2023.\n\nThe interval between visiting pandas marked the first time that the National Zoo has been without pandas since 1972, when the first \"panda ambassadors\" came to the U.S. following a historic visit to China by then-President Richard Nixon.\n\nOver the decades, relations between the two superpowers have ebbed and flowed, but panda diplomacy has, for the most part, been a consistent sign of goodwill between China and the United States, who've loaned and hosted, respectively, the gentle giants over the better part of the last 53 years.\n\nHere's a quick look back at the history of panda diplomacy, particularly between the U.S. and China:\n\nWhat is panda diplomacy and when did it start?\nPanda diplomacy \u2014 China's practice of loaning its pandas to foreign zoos to build ties with other countries \u2014 is believed to have started in the 7th century, when the Tang Dynasty Empress Wu Zeitan sent bears (pandas are only found in southwest China, and are considered a national treasure there) to Japan, according to History.com.\n\nPandas as a World War II 'thank you'\nAs World War II was raging in Asia and Europe and the U.S. was still weighing whether to get involved, China sent a pair of pandas to the Bronx Zoo in New York as a gesture of thanks, according to History.com. Communist Party Chairman Mao Zedong would also send pandas to its allies North Korea and the Soviet Union during the 1950s. United Press International's archives also include a story about pandas being sent to the Bronx Zoo in 1987.\n\nRichard Nixon visits China; pandas come to the U.S.\nIn 1972, U.S. President Richard Nixon visited China, ending 25 years of tense relations between the two countries. Two months later, Nixon and his wife Pat welcomed Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling, two pandas gifted to the U.S. from China and its premier, Zhou Enlai. American zoos lobbied the White House to be able to host the pandas. Ultimately, the National Zoo became their temporary home.\n\nThey proved to be wildly popular attractions, according to the Nixon Presidential Library, with more than 20,000 people clamoring to see the pandas on their public debut; the following Sunday, 75,000 people, forming a line that was a quarter mile long, thronged the zoo to see them. In return, the U.S. sent China a pair of musk oxen named Milton and Mathilda.\n\nMilton and Mathilda didn't fare quite as well initially: Time Magazine reported at the time that they suffered from \"culture shock\" that caused nasal drips and hair loss. (They recovered.)\n\nLing-Ling died in 1992 from heart failure at age 23; Hsing-Hsing, suffering from kidney disease and other health issues, was euthanized in 1999 at the age of 28.\n\nPanda problems and limitations\nIn 1984, China began allowing its pandas to be hosted abroad in 10-year loan periods and required an annual fee ($1 million US dollars). Any cubs born overseas would remain Chinese property. The U.S. in 1988 said it would pay the fee only if half of the proceeds went to conservation efforts.\n\nA 2008 earthquake in Sichuan province destroyed much of the pandas' natural habitat and China's largest conservation center. China began sending pandas overseas for breeding and research; its loans also tended to be tied to trade deals, especially with European countries, according to History.com.\n\nGoodbye, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian; hello, Bao Li and Qing Bao\nFor 23 years, Mei Xiang and Tian Tian delighted visitors at the National Zoo. The two arrived in 2000, as reported by Smithsonian Magazine, and in August 2020 the pair had a cub, Xiao Qi Ji.\n\nThe little panda family returned to China in 2023, and there were concerns that rising tensions between the U.S. and China might spell the end of the two countries' panda diplomacy.\n\nA few months later, though, the National Zoo announced pandas would return. On Friday, the public got to see them once again.\n\nIn May, when the pandas' return to the National Zoo was announced, Barbara Bodine, director of the Institute for the Study of Diplomacy at Georgetown University who had more than 30 years\u2019 experience in US foreign service, called pandas \"probably the most successful soft diplomacy animals any nation has ever come up with.\"","issue":"panda-diplomacy","url":"https:\/\/www.usatoday.com\/story\/news\/nation\/2025\/01\/24\/panda-diplomacy-history-us-china-explained\/77927954007\/","sources":[{"Name":"History.com","Biography":"History.com is a digital platform that provides historical insights and context on various topics such as events, figures, and cultural trivia.","Information":"According to History.com, panda diplomacy \u2014 China's practice of loaning its pandas to foreign zoos to establish and strengthen diplomatic relationships \u2014 is traced back to the 7th century when the Tang Dynasty Empress Wu Zeitan sent bears, the panda species unique to southwest China and considered a national treasure, to Japan."},{"Name":"Nixon Presidential Library","Biography":"The Nixon Presidential Library is a U.S. historical archive and museum dedicated to preserving and providing access to documents, artifacts, and resources related to President Richard Nixon's life and public service.","Information":"The Nixon Presidential Library reported that U.S. President Richard Nixon's 1972 visit to China marked a pivotal point in U.S.-China relations, seeing the culmination in the gifting of two pandas, Hsing-Hsing and Ling-Ling, to the U.S. Over 20,000 people visited to see these pandas at their first public appearance, and the following weekend, 75,000 people formed a long queue at the National Zoo.

{"title":"A brief history of 'panda diplomacy' - with new additions to global zoos","author":"Mia Taylor","content":"With the latest panda additions to the San Diego Zoo, 'panda diplomacy' is back in the vernacular. Here's what it means and why it's so important.\n\nAfter a month and a half of settling into their new home at San Diego Zoo, two giant pandas \u2013 Yun Chuan and Xin Bao \u2013 are receiving their first visits from the public.\n\nTheir arrival in the United States at the end of June 2024 marked the latest twist in China's use of its charismatic, bamboo-munching black-and-white bears as part of its international relations.\n\nThis \"panda diplomacy\" has a long history, that dates perhaps as far as the Tang Dynasty, which ruled from 618 through 907 CE. The movement of the animals around the world offers some insights into the ebb and flow of China's relationships with other nations.\n\nThe arrival of Yun Chuan and Zin Bao follows the recent recall of three giant pandas that had been living at the National Zoo in Washington DC and one living at the Memphis Zoo in Tennessee. Until June 2024, it left only four pandas in the US, all at the zoo in Atlanta, Georgia. Similarly, in the UK, two giant pandas that had lived at Edinburgh Zoo since 2011 were recalled in 2023.\n\nThose decisions arrived at a time when relations between Beijing and the West reached a particularly rocky phase. China and the US, for example, were navigating some decidedly tense security, humanitarian and economic challenges, according to an article about animal diplomacy from Georgetown University's Barbara Bodine, a distinguished professor of diplomacy and director of Georgetown's Institute for the Study of Diplomacy.\n\nFollowing the agreement to send the pandas to San Diego Zoo, Chinese Premier Li Qiang also offered to send pandas to Australia as the two countries restored relations following a diplomatic dispute over agricultural and mineral exports.\n\nThe renewed flurry of panda diplomacy may be part of China\u2019s pursuit of \"soft power\", explains Susan Brownell, a professor of anthropology at the University of Missouri-St. Louis and a member of the National Committee on US-China Relations, which works to promote understanding and cooperation between the two countries. Researchers at the University of Oxford have even gone so far as to chart the trajectory of China's \"soft cuddly power\" through its use of pandas in an academic paper published in 2013.\n\nThe story behind China's \"softest and sweetest elements of public diplomacy\"\n\nSince it was founded in 1949, the People's Republic of China has used giant pandas as a gesture of goodwill towards its international allies and competitors.\n\nThe animals are native to the high, bamboo-covered mountain slopes in south-central China but now only exist in the wild in six isolated valleys within protected nature reserves, where their numbers have dwindled to just 33 populations.\n\nChinese Communist Party leader Mao Zedong sent his first \"panda ambassadors\" as gifts to the Soviet Union in 1957 when he gifted the Ping Ping and Qi Qi to the USSR to mark the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution in Russia. He also gifted pandas to other socialist allies such as North Korea, in an effort to strengthen ties.\n\nA major diplomatic milestone was reached, however, in 1972 \u2013 just two months after US President Richard Nixon made his historic journey to China in an attempt to end more than two decades of frosty relations between the two countries \u2013 when an 18-month-old pair of pandas arrived in the US as a gift. The pair, named Hsing-Hsing and Ling Ling, remained in the US until they died. Ling Ling suffered heart failure in 1992. while Hsing-Hising lived to be 28 years old before he was put to sleep due to failing health in 1999.\n\nBut Hsing-Hsing and Ling Ling were far from the first pandas to be gifted to the US. In 1941, two pandas were sent to the US as a \"thank you\" gift from China by Chiang Kai-Shek for assisting Chinese refugees during the country's war with Japan.\n\nIt wasn't until 1972 that China gifted Japan two pandas \u2013 Kang Kang and Lan Lan \u2013 when the two countries normalised diplomatic ties. Then in 1984 the \"gifts\" changed to \"loans\" where zoos would pay substantial fees towards panda conservation projects in China. It can cost zoos up to $1m (\u00a3790,000) a year to host a pair of pandas, plus the costs of housing the animals, keeping them in fresh bamboo and in good health.\n\nMore recently, panda loan deals have coincided with lucrative trade agreements \u2013 something the Oxford University academics associated with the Chinese concept of \"guanxi\", which is the development of deep relationships and networks of influence built on trust, loyalty and reciprocity.\n\nAustralia, for example, was loaned pandas in 2009, while Canada and France received pandas in 2012. The timing appeared to coincide follow lucrative uranium deals and contracts between China and these countries, suggests Kathleen Buckingham and colleagues at the Oxford University in their paper. The loan of two pandas \u00ad\u2013 Tian Tian and Yang Guang \u2013 to Edinburgh Zoo in Scotland was agreed during negotiations over contracts to supply salmon meat, Land Rover vehicles and energy technology to China.\n\nThis flurry of panda loans followed the devastating earthquake in 2008 in China's Sichuan Province, which badly damaged the Wolong Nature Reserve and Breeding Centre, meaning the animals living there needed to be rehomed.\n\nBut there are still examples where pandas are used as a way of repairing strains between China and its global neighbours. Following the March 2014 disappearance of Malaysian Airlines Flight 370, relations between China and Malaysia became fraught. The arrival of two pandas that same year in Malaysia was seen as a peace offering.\n\nChina also seems happy to use its pandas to signal displeasure too \u2013 what it gives, it can take away. In 2010, two US-born panda cubs were on an aircraft back to China two days after Chinese officials warned President Barack Obama ahead of a planned meeting between Obama and the Dalia Lama that they could take \"corresponding action\". The pandas were due to be returned to China two years earlier but stayed in the US due to their popularity with visitors.\n\nThe arrival of San Diego's new pandas \u2013 Yun Chuan and Xin Bao \u2013 makes them the first of the Chinese bears to enter the US in 21 years. They are expected to be followed by another pair of two-year-old pandas \u2013 Bao Li and Qing Bao \u2013 who are to be housed at the Smithsonian's National Zoo in Washington DC, around a year after the zoo returned three of its pandas to China. The loan agreement formed part of a 10-year research and breeding cooperation agreement.\n\nAs for what the pandas may be promising today, Brownell suggests China is hoping to broaden its influence around the world. \"They know very well that their growing economic and military strength is viewed as a threat, particularly by the political leadership of the US,\" says Brownell. \"They also understand that a big factor [of US] influence in the world comes from the appeal of its cultural products, whether it's Hollywood movies or NBA stars.\n\n\"Their use of the lovable pandas, as well as the state promotion of Olympic sports, is part of their effort to develop that kind of appeal and influence in the world.\"\n\nI immediately found out it is about forming relationships \u2013 Greg Vicino\n\nSan Diego's new pandas\n\nSan Diego Zoo's newest residents will be in the US for 10 years under the loan agreement, which will help to support conservation breeding efforts in China. The male \u2013 Yun Chuan \u2013 is the son of Zhen Zhen, a cub born at San Diego Zoo in 2007 before being returned to China in 2010, and is due to turn five years old later this year. The new female panda at San Diego Zoo, whose name Xin Bao means \"previous treasure of prosperity and abundance\", is due to turn four years old.\n\nSince arriving in the US in June, the pair have spent their first weeks away from public view, settling into their new enclosure, which features trees for climbing and rolling \"hillsides\" inspired by the mountains and canyons of China's native panda habitats. Veterinary experts from the US and China have been tracking the pandas' health after their long flight to San Diego, regularly measuring their weight, appetite and blood samples. They have also been having regular ultrasound and computed tomography (CT) scans in an effort to pick up on any health problems early.\n\nVisitors to the zoo were able to get their first look at the two pandas on 8 August when they made their public debut.\n\nSan Diego Zoo was previously home to giant pandas from 1996 until their departure in 2019 and during that time a total of six pandas were born. Bai Yun and Shi Shi gave birth to the first panda cub to survive in captivity in the US, and later Bi Yung and Gao Gao gave birth to five more cubs. There was also a substantial body of research published as a result of the breeding programme.\n\n\"There was a steady flow back and forth [between San Diego and China] of researchers, scientists and graduate students coming here and going there,\" according to Greg Vicino, vice president of wildlife care at the San Diego Zoo. \"That collaboration \u2013 when you look at the list of publications that came out of that \u2013 is overwhelming. It was a big win for conservation.\"\n\nAnd ultimately, says Vicino, conservation boils down to relationships. \"I can tell you from my own experience, having worked in this field for over 20 years now, that I naively thought conservation was about saving habitats and saving species. But I immediately found out it is about forming relationships.\" Joking that diplomacy is something he'll \"leave to the pros\", Vicino adds: \"This is really about one-on-one contact between true conservationists from different countries.\"\n\n* This article was originally published on 26 February 2024.

{"title":"The debut of new pandas in D.C. marks the latest chapter in China's 'panda diplomacy'","author":"Rachel Treisman","content":"What's black, white and back in the nation's capital? Giant pandas, at last.\n\nBao Li and Qing Bao, both three years old, are making their public debut at the Smithsonian National Zoological Park (aka the National Zoo) on Friday after months of anticipation and fanfare \u2014 including panda-themed pop-up bars, hotel packages and special-edition transit cards. \n\nThe pair arrived in D.C. \u2014 aboard the fittingly nicknamed \"Panda Express\" \u2014 from China back in October. Since then, they could only be glimpsed occasionally on the zoo's social media feed (including rolling around in the flurries during a snowstorm earlier this month).\n\nNow, after a requisite quarantine and brief preview period for zoo members, the panda exhibit and its accompanying Giant Panda Cam are back on full display. \n\n\"Bao Li and Qing Bao have already won the hearts of our staff and volunteers, and we are excited to welcome panda fans back to the Zoo \u2014 the only place in the nation where you can see giant pandas for free \u2014 and celebrate the newest chapter of our giant panda breeding and conservation program,\" said Brandie Smith, director of the Smithsonian's National Zoo and Conservation Biology Institute.\n\nScientists estimate there are fewer than 2,000 giant pandas living in the wild, scattered throughout half a dozen mountainous regions in China. About 420 pandas live in captivity in zoos and reserves, mostly but not exclusively in China. \n\nThat's because, over the last half a century, China has either gifted or loaned its beloved bears to zoos around the world, a practice that's become known as \"panda diplomacy.\" In exchange, zoos pay a hefty fee to support panda conservation programs in China.\n\nUnder the National Zoo's agreement, Bao Li and Qing Bao will stay in D.C. until 2034, and any cubs they birth will move to China by age four. The zoo is paying $1 million annually to contribute to projects including restoring giant panda habitat, monitoring wildlife diseases and assessing the impacts of climate change.\n\nIn addition to D.C., the San Diego Zoo welcomed two pandas in 2024, while the San Francisco Zoo is anticipating the arrival of a pair this year.\n\nPanda diplomacy is seen as a way for China to not only conserve wildlife but promote goodwill and strengthen diplomatic ties with other countries \u2014 bringing a whole new meaning to soft power.\n\n\"Many people don't realize it, but there are actually two Chinese ambassadors in Washington: me and the panda cub at the National Zoo,\" Cui Tiankai, China's then-ambassador to the U.S., wrote in a 2013 Washington Post op-ed.\n\nHere's a look at the current state of panda diplomacy \u2014 and how we got here.\n\nThe early years: Panda-monium starts to spread\n\nThe first living giant panda exhibited in the U.S. was named Su Lin. The three-month-old cub was captured and brought over from China in 1936 by American fashion designer and socialite Ruth Harkness, who was inspired to carry out her late husband's dream.\n\nSu Lin, who was named after Harkness' Chinese guide's sister-in-law \u2014 he was believed to be female until after his death \u2014 ended up at Chicago's Brookfield Zoo, where he became a star attraction, winning over celebrity admirers including Shirley Temple. He died of pneumonia in 1938, just weeks after Harkness brought back another panda from China \u2014 Mei Mei \u2014 to join him. Su Lin's body is still on display at Chicago's Field Museum.\n\nForeigners captured and took over a dozen pandas from China over the next decade, according to the World Wildlife Foundation (WWF), whose logo happens to be a panda. By the 1940s, China sought to end the exploitation of its pandas by foreigners, but recognized it had something special to offer its friends.\n\nE. Elena Songster, a history professor at St. Mary's College of California who authored Panda Nation: The Construction and Conservation of China's Modern Icon, told WBUR in 2024 that the first time pandas were used \"as diplomatic expression\" was in 1941.\n\n\"Chiang Kai-shek's wife, Soong Mei-ling, offered a pair of pandas to the United States as an expression of gratitude for our assistance with them in their war of resistance against Japan,\" she explained.\n\nThe People's Republic of China continued that practice in the years after it took over in 1949. The U.S. initially didn't recognize and tried to weaken the communist government, forbade American citizens from visiting the country and encouraged its allies not to have diplomatic relations with China.\n\nChina began gifting pandas to its allies, including the Soviet Union and North Korea. It sent its first panda ambassadors, Ping Ping and Qi Qi, to the Soviet Union in 1957 to celebrate the 40th anniversary of the October Revolution, writes Yu Tao, a professor of Chinese Studies at the University of Western Australia.\n\nBetween 1957 and 1983, the country sent 24 pandas to foreign countries, including the U.S. \n\nMid-20th century: Panda diplomacy reaches the U.S.\n\nThe U.S. and China began to warm to each other throughout the 1970s, with President Richard Nixon's landmark 1972 visit signaling the beginning of a policy of engagement.\n\nA pivotal moment came when China gave its first pair of pandas to the U.S., just months after Nixon's trip.\n\nAt a dinner in Beijing, while seated next to Chinese Premier Zhou Enlai, First Lady Patricia Nixon commented on a box of cigarettes decorated with pandas: \"Aren't they cute? I love them.\"\n\n\"I'll give you some,\" he replied, according to the Richard Nixon Foundation.\n\nZhou gifted two giant pandas to the U.S., and the Nixons chose the National Zoo as their home.\n\nLing-Ling and Hsing-Hsing arrived in April 1972 and lived at the zoo for the next two decades. They drew millions of visitors until their deaths in 1992 and 1999, and set a new tradition in motion.\n\n\"[The gift] made a huge splash because the U.S. was a former enemy state, and so it was a giant gesture of diplomatic friendship,\" Songster explains. \"And from that moment, [China] saw how warmly welcomed the pandas were and how popular they were and how useful they were for putting a friendly face on China.\"\n\nBy 1979, the U.S. and China had established full diplomatic relations.\n\nAs other countries \u2014 including West Germany and Japan \u2014 recognized Beijing in the early 1970s, they received pandas of their own. Soon, however, the practice began to look unsustainable. \n\nTurn of the millennium: Gifts turn into loans\n\nIn the mid-1980s, China stopped giving pandas as gifts over concerns about its ability to maintain the wild population.\n\n\"And also at that time, there was a panda starvation scare, because there was a huge bamboo die-off in the pandas' range,\" Songster explained. \"And so from that point forward, they started loaning them.\"\n\nThat shift also embodied \"China's market-orientated economic reforms,\" Tao wrote, with bears bringing in some $500,000 to $1 million per year.\n\nWhile loan periods were initially relatively short, by the 1990s they had grown to at least 10 years, Songster said, proving less stressful for the animals and more conducive to reproduction.\n\nIn 1998, the U.S. shifted its acceptance policy to only allow a panda to reside stateside if China devoted more than half of its annual fee to conservation efforts, according to the History Channel. \n\nToday: What pandas can tell us about politics \n\nScholars have noted that China's panda strategy has evolved over the decades from strategic gift-giving to a financial transaction to, as of recent years, a symbol of trade relationships.\n\nIndeed, many of China's panda loans have coincided with trade deals. Shortly after the Edinburgh Zoo received two pandas in 2011, Scotland and China signed trade agreements involving salmon and renewable energy technology. The loan of two pandas to Germany in 2017 overlapped with Chinese leader Xi Jinping's visit to Berlin.\n\nThe timing of panda loans has also seemed to reflect the level of tension between China and other nations.\n\nThe arrival of two pandas to Malaysia in 2014 \u2014 to mark the 40th anniversary of its diplomatic ties with Beijing \u2014 was delayed by several months because of disagreements over Malaysia's handling of the disappearance of Flight MH370 (many of its passengers were Chinese). \n\nIn November 2023, the National Zoo sent its three pandas \u2014 Tian Tian and Mei Xiang, who had lived there since 2000, and their cub Xiao Qi Ji \u2014 back to China, in advance of the expiration of their loan agreement and amidst rising tensions between the two countries.\n\nThere was no agreement in place at the time for a new set of pandas to head to D.C., and Atlanta was left as the only zoo in the country housing any pandas.\n\nA week later, however, Xi signaled openness to sending more pandas to the U.S., specifically California. And in May 2024, the official announcement came down: A pair of pandas \u2014 Bao Li and Qing Bao \u2014 would arrive in the States by the end of the year.

{"title":"The Giant Pandas Are Back at the National Zoo. But Are U.S.-China Relations Any Different?","author":"Georgetown University Newsroom","content":"This week, the National Zoo welcomed two new yet familiar faces to Washington, DC: giant pandas.\n\nThe return of the pandas follows the departure of three pandas who were sent back to China in 2023 following an expired previous agreement and frosty U.S.-China relations.\n\nThe two new pandas, Bao Li and Qing Bao, will live in the National Zoo as part of a 10-year agreement with China, which owns every panda in the world.\n\nBut does this return signal a shift in bilateral relations?\n\nLast year, we asked Ambassador Barbara K. Bodine, distinguished professor in the practice of diplomacy and director of Georgetown\u2019s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, about the state of U.S.-China relations and the history of animal diplomacy after the trio left.\n\nThis year, we asked what, if anything, has changed that would warrant the return of pandas to DC \u2014 and whether we may be reading too much into the latest episode of panda diplomacy.\n\n### Ask a Professor: Barbara Bodine on the Return of the Pandas and U.S.-China Relations\n\n**The giant pandas are back in DC. Does this signal any meaningful shift in U.S.-China relations? Should we be reading into this?**\n\nPanda deliveries can signal a positive shift in relations between China and another country. Studies have been published showing that panda deliveries have been timed around all sorts of deals between China and other countries, from diplomatic recognition to uranium trade agreements.\n\nAs for this delivery \u2014 we shouldn\u2019t read much into it. Bilateral relations have been tense since well before the pandas\u2019 last departure in October 2023. Absent a major announcement \u2014 highly unlikely in an election year \u2014 we can only infer that China continues to use pandas as a tool for cultural diplomacy.\n\n**It seemed unlikely last year that the pandas would return. What\u2019s changed? Did the return of the pandas come with any strings attached?**\n\nThis is probably something a little more mundane: China is, to its credit, serious about panda conservation. Though pandas are no longer endangered, they are still classified as \u201cvulnerable\u201d by the World Wildlife Fund (largely thanks to Chinese efforts). Conservation of large animals is expensive. On top of upkeep costs, the Smithsonian Zoo pays $1 million a year to the China Wildlife Conservation Association for housing DC\u2019s furry friends.\n\nSeveral countries, most recently Finland, have had to return pandas to China due to the high cost of their upkeep. As a well-endowed organization, the Smithsonian doesn\u2019t face quite the same constraints as smaller zoos in smaller countries. As a reliable partner in conservation, we have just made a major commitment by taking in these pandas.\n\n**What are you monitoring in the coming months that could affect U.S.-China relations?**\n\nIt\u2019s October in an election year, which sucks up all the media oxygen. Trump wants to double and triple down on his tariff policies this time around. Harris is also hawkish on China, though she would likely continue the Biden policy of light-touch tariffs alongside heavy import and export controls on high-value and military-related technologies \u2014 think semiconductors and their components.\n\nChinese leaders will be watching the election unfold just as closely as the rest of the world.\n\n**What was your personal reaction to this news of a return?**\n\nI cannot help but note the power of cultural diplomacy and admire China\u2019s dedication to pandas as a symbol. The Washington Post is awash with pictures of happy children dressed in costumes, no doubt begging their parents for a trip to the zoo; shops and businesses around the zoo have stocked up on panda-related merchandise; and the animal-crazy corners of the internet are jubilant. Cultural diplomacy is a good thing, but it is still government policy with an agenda behind it.","issue":"panda-diplomacy","url":"https:\/\/www.georgetown.edu\/news\/dc-pandas-return-ask-a-professor\/","sources":[{"Name":"Ambassador Barbara K.

{"title":"Russia's war in Ukraine: How it came to this","author":"Tucker Reals","content":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy says he's ready to compromise NATO ambitions to end Putin's war After Russia spent weeks building up a huge military force along its border with Ukraine and in neighboring Belarus, Russian leader Vladimir Putin launched what Ukrainian officials described as a \"full-scale invasion\" of the country on February 24, 2022. It marked the start of a grim new chapter in, and a major expansion of an eight-year war in the country's east that had already claimed thousands of lives.\n\n\"Peace on our continent has been shattered,\" NATO Secretary-General Jens Stoltenberg said the morning after the invasion began. \"We now have war in Europe on a scale and of a type we thought belonged to history.\"\n\nHere's what you need to know about the events and the thinking that led to the war.\n\nA brief summary of a long history In the late 1700s, much of Ukraine's territory became part of the Russian empire under Catherine the Great. Ukraine fought for independence in the early 20th century but lost and became part of the Soviet Union. \n\n\"But it was a separate entity from the beginning,\" historian Anne Applebaum explained on CBS \"Sunday Morning\". \"It always had its own language. It always had its own status inside the USSR.\"\n\nUnder Stalin's grip in the 1930s, Ukrainians' farmland and wheat were confiscated and a resulting famine killed an estimated 4 million people.\n\nUkraine declared its independence after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991. At the time, a substantial portion of the Soviet nuclear arsenal was housed within Ukraine's borders, and it agreed to transfer those weapons to Russia.\n\nIn recent years, Ukraine's democratically elected government has grown closer to Western Europe, but cultural ties with Russia, especially in the Russian-speaking eastern portion of the country, remain deep.\n\nRussia has invaded Ukraine before Russian forces last invaded eastern Ukraine in 2014. As he has this time, Putin claimed the assault was merely a defense of ethnic Russians who live in the eastern Donbas region, many of whom have never supported the country's relatively new pro-Western government.\n\nBut Putin used the invasion to claim part of Ukraine for Russia, unilaterally annexing the Crimean Peninsula. The annexation is not recognized by the international community, but Russia has indisputably controlled the territory since 2014.\n\nSince 2014, a proxy war had simmered in Donbas between the Russian-backed separatist forces and the Ukrainian government. A 2015 peace deal largely ended major battles but the fighting continued, leaving more than 14,000 people dead in the process, according to the Ukrainian government.\n\nThree days before his latest invasion, Putin unilaterally recognized the independence of two breakaway regions in Donbas \u2014 the self-declared \"People's Republics\" of Donetsk and Luhansk. The move led to the U.S. and its allies imposing new sanctions on Russia.\n\nNow, as Ukraine's ambassador to the U.N. told CBS News correspondent Pamela Falk, Putin's ambition to \"restore the Russian Empire\" has moved beyond the annexation of Ukraine's Crimean Peninsula, which his forces seized in 2014.\n\nWhat does Putin want? Russia's strongman leader speaks often of the ethnic ties between Russia and Ukraine and warns against NATO expanding further eastward toward his borders.\n\nRetired General H.R. McMaster, a former national security adviser, said on \"CBS Mornings\" following the invasion that Putin was trying to \"restore Russia to national greatness.\"\n\n\"This goes back to the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991 \u2014 what Putin saw as a disaster and what Putin has been driven by since that time and since he took over in the year 2000, you know, 22 years ago,\" McMaster said. \"He's been driven by an obsession with restoring Russia to national greatness. And his plan to do that is not to make Russia great, it's really to drag everybody else down, and you're seeing, you know, this sustained campaign against, you know, any of the former territories of the Soviet Union and the former Warsaw Pact countries, really, designed to restore Russian influence.\"\n\nWeeks before the invasion, Andrea Kendall-Taylor, a former senior intelligence analyst, told CBS News national security contributor Michael Morell she thought there were also \"legacy issues at play\" for Putin.\n\n\"Putin is thinking long term,\" she said. \"I think he believes that he is the last Russian leader who would be willing to take such risks to reassert Russia's role as a great power. And so I think for him, the time is, his clock is ticking... He sees the West as being in decline. He sees the United States is distracted. He sees the trans-Atlantic relationship as under strain and he is leaning in now, I think, to accomplish these very maximalist objectives because I think that he views this as the opportune moment to do that.\"\n\nAs CBS News' David Martin reported in January, Putin's objective is to keep Ukraine \u2014 the second-largest country on the continent \u2014 from making common cause with the democracies of Europe.\n\n\"What motivates Putin,\" former NATO Ambassador Ivo Daalder told CBS News, \"is a concern about the independence of Ukraine \u2014 a worry that a functioning, successful, prosperous democracy in Ukraine poses a direct threat to his rule, because it will give people in Russia the idea that they, too, could enjoy what Ukraine enjoys, and rise up against his autocratic rule.\"\n\nBefore Russia launched the current invasion, Putin demanded that NATO rule out admitting any new members from among the former Soviet states \u2014 most importantly, Ukraine \u2014 and that NATO forces pull back from positions in other countries near Russia. The U.S. and NATO flatly rejected the demand to preclude any new members.\n\nMany analysts believe Putin's objective is topple Ukraine's current government so it can be replaced with a new pro-Russian regime.\n\nIs Ukraine a NATO member? No. Ukraine has made the quest for NATO membership a cornerstone of its national security policy, and it refused to back down from that ambition even as Russia's invasion became more brutal. Even before the current conflict there was no discussion of Ukraine being admitted to the alliance anytime soon.\n\nWhile many Ukrainians, especially in the country's east, are pro-Russian, Ukrainians ousted their last pro-Russia president in 2014 and have consistently elected pro-Western politicians since.\n\n\"The Ukrainians want to be in NATO,\" Ukraine's U.N. Ambassador Sergiy Kyslytsya told CBS News' Pamela Falk in early February. \"Before 2014, they were already very pro-European Union... At that moment and before 2014, there was no majority. If you polled the nation, we wouldn't have more than 50% of Ukrainians in favor of the NATO membership. Now, we have very high figures of Ukrainians if they ask if they want to be in NATO. Because now they realize that trying to defend ourselves on our own is not only questionable from the military point of view, but it is also exceptionally expensive economically and financially.\"\n\nBut by late February, amid direct negotiations between his government and Russia, President Volodymr Zelenskyy indicated for the first time that Ukraine was willing to consider adopting a neutral status as a nation.\n\nBy early March there were hints that the talks could be making some headway, and Zelenskyy told a group of European allies that his country had to accept the door to NATO membership was \"closed.\"\n\nWhy is it America's problem? As Ukraine is not a NATO member, the U.S. and most of its European allies have ruled out sending troops into the country to help defend its territory. Instead, they have provided military hardware, cash, and diplomatic support.\n\nThe U.S. interest in rebuffing Russia's aggression is difficult to explain in terms of goods or American lives: Ukraine is not a significant trading partner, and a threat to its territory or sovereignty poses no direct threat to that of the United States.\n\nBut the world's most powerful democracies have struggled for years to keep Putin's myriad nefarious actions in check \u2014 from claiming Crimea, to poisoning dissidents on British soil and helping the Assad regime wage a brutal war its own people in Syria.\n\nAs Putin seeks now to deepen Russia's ties with China, another powerful nation eager to portray the Western model of democracy as past its prime, the U.S. has a clear interest in turning back his latest and boldest effort to drive a wedge between NATO members.\n\nEleanor Watson, Olivia Gazis, David Martin, Ed O'Keefe, Sara Cook, Margaret Brennan and Christina Ruffini contributed reporting.","issue":"russia-ukraine-invasion","url":"https:\/\/www.cbsnews.com\/news\/ukraine-news-russia-war-how-we-got-here\/","sources":[{"Name":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy","Biography":"President of Ukraine, a former comedian and actor who took office in May 2019","Information":"Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy has expressed willingness to compromise on Ukraine's ambitions to join NATO in an effort to halt the ongoing conflict initiated by Russian President Vladimir Putin.

{"title":"Russian Invasion of Ukraine","author":"Wikipedia contributors","content":"On 24 February 2022, Russia invaded Ukraine, starting the largest and deadliest war in Europe since World War II, in a major escalation of the conflict between the two countries which began in 2014.[15][16][17] The fighting has caused hundreds of thousands of military casualties and tens of thousands of Ukrainian civilian casualties. As of 2025, Russian troops occupy about 20% of Ukraine. From a population of 41 million, about 8 million Ukrainians had been internally displaced and more than 8.2 million had fled the country by April 2023, creating Europe's largest refugee crisis since World War II.\n\nIn late 2021, Russia massed troops near Ukraine's borders and issued demands to the West including a ban on Ukraine ever joining the NATO military alliance.[18] After repeatedly denying having plans to attack Ukraine, on 24 February 2022, Russian president Vladimir Putin announced a \"special military operation\", saying that it was to support the Russian-backed breakaway republics of Donetsk and Luhansk, whose paramilitary forces had been fighting Ukraine in the war in Donbas since 2014. Putin espoused irredentist and imperialist views challenging Ukraine's legitimacy as a state, baselessly claimed that the Ukrainian government were neo-Nazis committing genocide against the Russian minority in the Donbas, and said that Russia's goal was to \"demilitarise and denazify\" Ukraine.[19][20][21][22] Russian air strikes and a ground invasion were launched on a northern front from Belarus towards the capital Kyiv, a southern front from Crimea, and an eastern front from the Donbas and towards Kharkiv. Ukraine enacted martial law, ordered a general mobilisation, and severed diplomatic relations with Russia.\n\nRussian troops retreated from the north and the outskirts of Kyiv by April 2022, after encountering stiff resistance and logistical challenges. The Bucha massacre was uncovered after their withdrawal. In the southeast, Russia launched an offensive in the Donbas and captured Mariupol after a destructive siege. Russia continued to bomb military and civilian targets far from the front, and struck the energy grid during winter months. In late 2022, Ukraine launched successful counteroffensives in the south and east, liberating most of Kharkiv Oblast. Soon after, Russia illegally annexed four partly-occupied provinces. In November, Ukraine liberated Kherson. In June 2023, Ukraine launched another counteroffensive in the southeast but made few gains. After small but steady Russian advances in the east in the first half of 2024, Ukraine launched a cross-border offensive into Russia's Kursk Oblast in August, where North Korean soldiers were sent to assist Russia. The United Nations Human Rights Office reports that Russia is committing severe human rights violations in occupied Ukraine. The direct cost of the war for Russia has been over US$450 billion.[23][24][25]\n\nThe invasion was met with widespread international condemnation. The United Nations General Assembly passed a resolution condemning the invasion and demanding a full Russian withdrawal. The International Court of Justice ordered Russia to halt military operations, and the Council of Europe expelled Russia. Many countries imposed sanctions on Russia and its ally Belarus and provided large-scale humanitarian and military aid to Ukraine. The Baltic states and Poland declared Russia a terrorist state. Protests occurred around the world, with anti-war protesters in Russia being met by mass arrests and greater media censorship. The Russian attacks on civilians have led to allegations of genocide.[26][27][28][29] War-related disruption to Ukrainian agriculture and shipping contributed to a world food crisis; war-related local environmental damage has been described as ecocide and the war has heavily disrupted global climate policy. The International Criminal Court (ICC) opened an investigation into crimes against humanity, war crimes, abduction of Ukrainian children, and genocide against Ukrainians. The ICC issued arrest warrants for Putin and five other Russian officials.\n\n[15] See notes for citations\n\n[16] See bibliography for references \n\n[17] Consult the bibliography for additional sources \n\n[18] See further information about Russia\u2013Ukraine relations \n\n[19] Consult notes for footnotes \n\n[20] Find more about Ukrainian revolution \n\n[21] For prelude details see article \n\n[22] Events are covered further in the article \n\n[23] Economic aspects and relations section covers more about the costs \n\n[24] For further impacts, check the casualties section \n\n[25] Bibliography contains more about international reactions \n\n[26] Refer to the article for peace efforts and efforts \n\n[27] Consult the outlined strategies for additional strategies \n\n[28] Check war crimes and attacks on civilians for more \n\n[29] Maps and detailed scenarios are available throughout","issue":"russia-ukraine-invasion","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Russian_invasion_of_Ukraine#External_links","sources":[{"Name":"United Nations Human Rights Office","Biography":"A global intergovernmental organization responsible for promoting and protecting human rights as guaranteed under international law.

Russian shelling of the southeastern Ukraine facility set off a fire, which Ukrainian officials warned could set off a nuclear disaster. It took hours, but the fire was extinguished, and international monitors said that they do not detect elevated radiation levels and that the fire did not damage \u201cessential\u201d equipment. US officials have said Russia now appears to be in control of the plant.\n\nBut the incident was a reminder of how dangerous this war in Ukraine is becoming, and how uncertain and confusing things still are on the ground. Russian troops were advancing toward Kyiv, and thousands and thousands are fleeing in advance of a possible siege on the city.\n\nThe Russian military has made advances in the south, and are gaining in the area of Kherson, a port city on the Black Sea whose control is reportedly contested, and Mariupol, on the Sea of Azov. Russian bombardment of these cities has resulted in humanitarian issues, with bridges and roads damaged by the fighting and dwindling access to food, clean water, medicine, and electricity in certain areas. Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city, experienced heavy Russian fire this week, and strikes have heavily damaged residential areas.\n\nUkrainian and Russian officials met in early March, and tentatively agreed on the need for humanitarian corridors \u2014 basically, safe zones for civilians to flee and supplies to pass through \u2014 but did not reach agreements on a larger ceasefire. As of March 6, multiple attempts to evacuate Ukrainian civilians have been halted because of Russian shelling.\n\nPutin\u2019s attempt to redraw the map of Europe risks becoming the most devastating conflict on the continent since World War II. Already, it is causing an astounding humanitarian crisis: Hundreds, perhaps thousands, of civilians have died, and more than 1.5 million people have fled the violence so far, according to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, making it the fastest-growing refugee crisis in Europe since World War II.\n\nThe battle for Ukraine began in the early morning hours, local time, on February 24, when Russian President Vladimir Putin launched what he called a \u201cspecial military operation\u201d into the country of about 40 million. He claimed the Russian military seeks \u201cdemilitarization and denazification\u201d but not occupation; attacks shortly followed from multiple fronts and targeted toward multiple cities.","issue":"russia-ukraine-invasion","url":"https:\/\/www.vox.com\/2022\/2\/23\/22948534\/russia-ukraine-war-putin-explosions-invasion-explained","sources":[{"Name":"Ukrainian officials","Biography":"Government representatives and authorities from Ukraine responsible for national security and crisis management.","Information":"Ukrainian officials raised alarm regarding Russia's seizure of Zaporizhzhia, emphasizing that Russian shelling caused a fire at the prominent nuclear power plant.

{"title":"After 3 months, Russia still bogged down in Ukraine war","author":"THE ASSOCIATED PRESS","content":"When Russia invaded Ukraine on Feb. 24, it had hoped to overtake the country in a blitz lasting only days or a few weeks. Many Western analysts thought so, too.\n\nAs the conflict marked its third month Tuesday, however, Moscow appears to be bogged down in what increasingly looks like a war of attrition, with no end in sight and few successes on the battlefield.\n\nThere was no quick victory for Russian President Vladimir Putin\u2019s powerful forces, no rout that would allow the Kremlin to control most of Ukraine and establish a puppet government.\n\nInstead, Russian troops got bogged down on the outskirts of Kyiv and other big cities amid stiff Ukrainian defenses. Convoys of Russian armor seemed stalled on long stretches of highway. Troops ran out of supplies and gasoline, becoming easy targets.\n\nA little over a month into the invasion, Russia effectively acknowledged the failure of its blitz and pulled troops back from areas near Kyiv, declaring a shift of focus to the eastern industrial region of the Donbas, where Moscow-backed separatists have been fighting Ukrainian forces since 2014.\n\nTo be sure, Russia has seized significant chunks of territory around the Crimean Peninsula that Moscow annexed eight years ago. It also has managed to cut Ukraine off completely from the Sea of Azov, finally securing full control over the key port of Mariupol after a siege that prevented some of its troops from fighting elsewhere while they battled diehard Ukrainian forces.\n\nBut the offensive in the east seems to have bogged down as well, as Western arms flow into Ukraine to bolster its outgunned army.\n\nRussian artillery and warplanes relentlessly pound Ukrainian positions, trying to break through defenses built up during the separatist conflict. They have made only incremental gains, clearly reflecting both Russia\u2019s insufficient troop numbers and the Ukrainian resistance. Russia recently lost hundreds of personnel and dozens of combat vehicles while trying to cross a river to build a bridgehead.\n\n\u201cThe Russians are still well behind where we believe they wanted to be when they started this revitalized effort in the eastern part of the country,\u201d Pentagon press secretary John Kirby said Friday, adding that small towns and villages were changing hands every day in the Donbas.\n\nElsewhere in Ukraine, Russian forces have methodically targeted Western weapons shipments, ammunition and fuel depots, and critical infrastructure in hopes of weakening Kyiv\u2019s military and economy.\n\nBut in trying to gain ground, Russian forces have also relentlessly shelled cities and laid siege to some of them. In the latest example of the war\u2019s toll, 200 bodies were found in a collapsed building in Mariupol, Ukrainian authorities said Tuesday.\n\nThe Kremlin appears to still harbor a more ambitious goal of cutting off Ukraine from the Black Sea coast all the way to the Romanian border, a move that would also give Moscow a land corridor to Moldova\u2019s separatist region of Transnistria, where Russian troops are stationed.\n\nBut Russia seems to know that this objective is not currently achievable with the limited forces it has.\n\n\u201cI think they\u2019re just increasingly realizing that they can\u2019t necessarily do all of it, certainly not at one go,\u201d said Justin Crump, a former British tank commander who heads Sibylline, a strategic advisory firm.\n\nMoscow\u2019s losses have forced it to rely increasingly on hastily patched-together units in the Donbas that could only make small gains, he said.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s a constant downshifting of gear toward smaller objectives that Russia can actually achieve,\u201d Crump said. \u201cAnd I think on the biggest scale, they\u2019ve actually downsized their strategy better to match their their ability on the ground.\u201d\n\nTwo top officials appeared to acknowledge Tuesday the advance has been slower than expected. Secretary of Russia\u2019s Security Council Nikolai Patrushev said it \u201cis not chasing deadlines,\u201d and Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu said the pace was deliberate to allow civilians to flee, even though forces have repeatedly hit civilian targets.\n\nMany in Ukraine and the West thought Putin would pour resources into the Donbas to score a decisive triumph by Victory Day on May 9, when Moscow celebrates its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II. Russia has falsely called the war a campaign to \u201cdenazify\u201d Ukraine \u2014 a country with a democratically elected Jewish president who wants closer ties with the West.\n\nRather than a massive campaign, however, the Kremlin opted for tactical mini-offensives, aimed at steadily trying to encircle Ukrainian forces.\n\n\u201cThe Russian leadership is urging the military command to show at least some gains, and it has nothing else to do but to keep sending more troops into the carnage,\u201d said Mykola Sunhurovskyi, a military expert at the Kyiv-based Razumkov Center think tank.\n\nMany in the West expected Putin to declare a broad troop mobilization, with British Defense Secretary Ben Wallace saying he might do it on Victory Day. That never happened, with Russia continuing to rely on a limited force that was clearly insufficient.\n\nA massive mobilization would likely foment discontent in Russia, fuel antiwar sentiment and carry political risks. Authorities opted for more limited options, with lawmakers drafting a bill to waive the current age limit of 40 for those willing to sign up for the military.\n\nThe lack of resources was underlined last week by an abrupt Russian withdrawal from areas near Kharkiv, Ukraine\u2019s second-largest city that has been bombarded since the war began. Some of those forces apparently were redeployed to the Donbas, but it wasn\u2019t enough to tip the scales.\n\n\u201cThey really had to thin out the troops they had around Kharkiv, simply because they\u2019re trying to hold to too much of a line with too few troops,\u201d said Phillips O\u2019Brien, professor of strategic studies at the University of St. Andrews in Scotland.\n\nThe Donbas fighting has increasingly become artillery duels, and \u201cit might go on for quite a long time without much movement in the lines,\u201d he said.\n\n\u201cSo it will be a more of a positional battle at that point, O\u2019Brien added, with success going to whoever \u201ccan take the pounding.\u201d\n\nUkraine, meanwhile, continues to get a steady flow of Western arms, including U.S. howitzers and drones, tanks from Poland and other heavy gear that is immediately sent into combat.\n\n\u201cUkraine\u2019s plan is simple and obvious \u2014 wear down the Russian forces in the nearest months as much as possible, win time for receiving Western weapons and training how to use them, and then launch a counteroffensive in the southeast,\u201d said Sunhurovskyi, the Kyiv-based military expert.\n\nHe said Ukraine hopes to receive even more powerful Western weapons, such as U.S. HIMARS multiple rocket launchers, anti-ship missiles and more potent air defense weapons.\n\nRussian hard-liners warn that Moscow can\u2019t win if it doesn\u2019t conduct a large mobilization and concentrate all of its resources in a decisive attack.\n\nIgor Strelkov, a former security officer who led the separatists in 2014, denounced what he described as the Kremlin\u2019s indecision, saying it could lead to defeat.\n\n\u201cFor Russia, the strategic deadlock is deepening,\u201d he said.\n\nUkrainian authorities are increasingly emboldened by the slow pace of the Russian offensive and growing Western support. President Volodymyr Zelenskyy reaffirmed last week that pushing the Russians back to pre-invasion positions would represent a victory, but some aides declared even more ambitious goals.\n\nAdviser Mykhailo Podolyak said Ukraine isn\u2019t interested in a cease-fire \u201cuntil Russia is ready to fully liberate occupied territories,\u201d a bold statement that appears to reflect hopes for reclaiming the Donbas and Crimea.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, apparently aims to bleed Ukraine by methodically striking fuel supplies and infrastructure while grinding out military gains. The Kremlin may also hope the West\u2019s attention will shift elsewhere.\n\n\u201cTheir final hope is that we will lose interest completely in the conflict in Ukraine by the summer,\u201d Crump said. \u201cThey\u2019re calculating the Western audiences will lose interest in the same way as Afghanistan last year. Russia thinks that time is working in its favor.\u201d\n\n___\nDanica Kirka in London, Lolita C.

{"title":"How One Crack in the Line Opened a Path for the Russians","author":"Marc Santora","content":"The thunder of ferocious clashes unfolded at the nearby front line as the Ukrainian crew prepared to maneuver its American-made Bradley fighting vehicle out of camouflage and into the fire.\n\nThe commander of the team, a sergeant with the call sign Lawyer, nervously scanned the sky. \u201cIf we are seen, the KABs will come,\u201d he said, referring to the one-ton bombs Russia has been using to target Ukraine\u2019s most valuable armor and defenses.\n\nWhat had started as a small Russian thrust into the tiny town of Ocheretyne was growing into a substantial breakthrough, threatening to unhinge the Ukrainian lines across a broad stretch of the eastern front. The crew\u2019s mission was to help contain the breach: protect outmanned and outgunned infantry soldiers, evacuate the wounded and use the Bradley\u2019s powerful 25-millimeter cannon against as many Russians as possible.\n\nBut the 28-ton vehicle was soon spotted. Mortars and rockets exploded all around, and the gunner was badly injured, said the commander, identified only by his call sign according to military protocol.\n\nA combat assignment had turned into a mission to rescue his comrade. The gunner survived and is now recovering, Lawyer said a few days later as he recounted the attack. But the Russians gained territory and are continuing to try to press forward.\n\nUkraine is more vulnerable than at any time since the first harrowing weeks of the 2022 invasion, Ukrainian soldiers and commanders from a range of brigades interviewed in recent weeks said. Russia is trying to exploit this window of opportunity, stepping up its assaults across the east and now threatening to open a new front by attacking Ukrainian positions along the northern border outside the city of Kharkiv.\n\nMonths of delays in American assistance, a spiraling number of casualties and severe shortages of ammunition have taken a deep toll, evident in the exhausted expressions and weary voices of soldiers engaged in daily combat.\n\n\u201cFrankly speaking, I have fears,\u201d said Lt. Col. Oleksandr Voloshyn, 57, the veteran tank battalion commander of the 59th Motorized Brigade. \u201cBecause if I will not have shells, if I will not have men, if I will not have equipment that my men can fight with\u2026,\u201d he said, trailing off. \u201cThat\u2019s it.\u201d\n\nThe sudden Russian advance through Ocheretyne, about nine miles northwest of Avdiivka, in late April, illustrates how even a small crack in the line can have cascading effects, as already-stretched platoons risk being flanked and encircled and other units race in to plug the breach.\n\n\u201cIt\u2019s like if you have an engine knock in your car, and you keep driving it,\u201d Lt. Oleksandr Shyrshyn, 29, the deputy battalion commander for the 47th Mechanized Brigade, said. \u201cThe car works, but at some point, it will just stop. Then you\u2019ll end up spending even more resources to restore it.\u201d\n\n\u201cSimilarly here, there are mistakes that do not seem critical,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019ve led to the need to stabilize the situation now. And it\u2019s uncertain where that stabilization will occur.\u201d\n\n\u201cEvery event you did not predict can turn your situation completely upside down,\u201d Lieutenant Shyrshyn said. \u201cAnd this is what happened in Ocheretyne.\u201d\n\nThe Ripple Effect\nAfter the fall of Avdiivka to Russian forces in February, the small town of Ochertyne served as a Ukrainian military strong point along a highway. Most of the 3,000 residents had fled. Abandoned high-rise apartment blocks and other urban infrastructure provided good defensive positions and for two months, the situation remained relatively stable.\n\nBut then something went wrong.\n\nThe Russians appeared so suddenly on the battered streets around Ivan Vivsianyk\u2019s home in late April that, at first glance, he mistook them for Ukrainian soldiers. When they asked him for his passport, the 88-year old knew the defense of Ocheretyne had collapsed.\n\n\u201cI thought that our soldiers would come and knock them out,\u201d he said in an interview after making what he called a harrowing walk across the front line to escape. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t happen.\u201d\n\nThree weeks later, what started as a small Russian advance has grown into a roughly 15-square-mile bulge that is complicating the defense of the Donetsk region.\n\nExtending the bulge farther north could allow the Russians a chance to bypass some of the strongest Ukrainian fortifications in the east that have held for years. Russia can now also take a new line of attack aimed at Konstiantynivka, a town that is a logistical linchpin for Ukrainian forces.\n\nThe Kremlin\u2019s bid to advance from one ruined village to the next has been captured in hours of combat footage shared by Ukrainian brigades at the front.\n\nRussian infantry storm across mine-strewn fields on foot and use dirt bikes and dune buggies to try and outrace Ukrainian exploding drones. They attack in armored columns of varying sizes, with large assaults often led by tanks covered with massive metal sheds and equipped with sophisticated electronic warfare equipment to protect against drones. Western observers have dubbed them \u201cturtle tanks.\u201d The Ukrainians call them \u201cwundervaflia,\u201d which combines the German word for wonder with the Ukrainian word for waffle.\n\n\u201cWe allow their infantry closer to us, which creates closer contact and direct firefights,\u201d Lieutenant Shyrshyn said. \u201cTherefore, our losses are increasing.\u201d\n\nThe Russians are also paying a staggering price for every step forward. Some 899 Russian soldiers per day were killed or wounded in April, Britain\u2019s military intelligence agency reported recently.\n\nDespite throwing so many soldiers into the fight, the Russians took an area covering only about 30 square miles in April, according to military analysts. And capturing Ukraine\u2019s last fortress cities in the Donbas \u0014 urban centers like Kramatorsk and Pokrovsk \u0014 would almost certainly involve long and bloody battles.\n\nStill, the Russian advances in recent weeks in the east and northeast are starting to alter the geometry of the front in dangerous ways.\n\nThe Fraying Line\n\u201cLook at the map, where we are and where Ocheretyne is,\u201d said Colonel Voloshyn, the tank battalion commander. He studied the terrain as he prepared to head out on a mission to target a house where 20 Russians were thought to be hiding. \u201cI can now assume that they can simply bypass us on the left, on the right. They have tactical success, they have equipment, men, shells. So we can expect everything.\u201d\n\nThe lack of dramatic shifts in the front for more than a year obscured the exhausting positional fighting needed to maintain that precarious balance. In a war where a battle over a single tree line can rage for weeks, the sudden Russian thrust into the area around Ocherytne was the most dangerous kind of problem \u0014 fast, deep and surprising.\n\nThere is a bitter debate over who was responsible for the failure to hold the line there.\n\nThe Deep State Telegram channel, which has close links to the Ukrainian army, accused the 115th Mechanized Brigade of leaving critical positions without orders, allowing the Russians to infiltrate and storm the settlement.\n\nThe brigade issued a furious denial, saying its soldiers were outnumbered by as much as 15 to one and held on as long as possible under withering bombardment.\n\n\u201cWe want to emphasize that no regular unit of the 115th Brigade of the Armed Forces of Ukraine left or fled positions,\u201d the brigade said. A special military commission has been established to determine what precisely what happened.\n\nSoldiers familiar with the fight were hesitant to publicly criticize a neighboring brigade and said a host of issues \u0014 from poor communication to being vastly outgunned \u0014 all likely played a role.\n\nLieutenant Shyrshyn of the 47th, which held positions next to the 115th, would not speculate on what went wrong, but said the consequences were immediate: It was soon clear that the 47th would have to fall back or risk encirclement and catastrophic losses.\n\n\u201cThe Russians sensed the weakness in that direction as they used the gaps to get in behind the Ukrainian soldiers,\u201d he said. \u201cThen we lost Ocheretyne, then Novobakhmutivka, then Soloviove.\u201d\n\nThe Ukrainian high command does not like to surrender any territory, the lieutenant said, adding that \u201cit is very complicated to argue with them and explain why it is not good to hold this position.\u201d\n\nLieutenant Shyrshyn hoped the situation would improve with the arrival of Western weapons but until then, he said, \u201cwe will continue to die, we will continue to lose territories\u201d\n\n\u201cThe question is whether it will be at a slow pace and defensible,\u201d he said. \u201cOr at a fast one and senseless.\u201d","issue":"russia-ukraine-invasion","url":"https:\/\/www.nytimes.com\/2024\/05\/14\/world\/europe\/ukraine-russia-war-battlefield.html","sources":[{"Name":"The Commander with Call Sign 'Lawyer'","Biography":"Sergeant and commander of the Bradley fighting vehicle team in the Ukrainian army.","Information":"Sergeant 'Lawyer' is the commander of a Ukrainian team operating an American-made Bradley fighting vehicle.

{"title":"Australia urged to do more on climate crisis as activists rue trillion-dollar Cop29 funding gap","author":"Adam Morton in Baku","content":"The Australian government has been urged to \u201cstep up\u201d and do more to address the climate crisis after a major UN summit ended with a global finance agreement that developing countries criticised for not going far enough.\n\nThe Cop29 talks in the Azerbaijan capital of Baku ended at 4am on Sunday with a consensus agreement that developing countries would be paid at least US$300bn (A$460bn) a year in global climate finance by 2035 to help them shift to a low-carbon economy and adapt to the impacts of extreme weather.\n\nWealthy nations, including Australia, agreed to \u201ctake the lead\u201d in getting there. But they acknowledged developing countries actually needed at least US$1.3tn (A$2tn) a year.\n\nThe countries agreed to work together to find a way to achieve the higher target. It could include funding from private investors and potential new taxes on, for example, shipping and aviation.\n\nThe $1.3tn was based on a calculation by leading economists but many activists demanded more \u2013 as much as US$7tn a year \u2013 based on wealthy nations\u2019 historic responsibility for rising damage caused by global heating.\n\nThe agreement cleared a final plenary session 34 hours after the scheduled close of the summit but some developing countries responded with fury, calling it not just a failure but a betrayal.\n\nIt may not have been accepted had the Azeri Cop29 president, Mukhtar Babayev, not gavelled it through before India could express its objection. India\u2019s delegate, Chandni Raina, said the deal was an \u201coptical illusion\u201d and suggested the country would have blocked it given the chance.\n\nAustralia\u2019s climate change minister, Chris Bowen, was a co-facilitator leading negotiations with nearly 200 countries on the design before making recommendations to the Azeri hosts. Bowen left before the final plenary on a pre-booked flight to return to Australia for parliament on Monday. Australia was represented by diplomats in the final stages.\n\nErin Ryan, a senior international campaigner at Climate Action Network Australia, said Cop29 had \u201cended as it ran\u201d, held hostage by the interest of high-income countries and a petrostate host.\n\nShe said an annual goal of US$300bn might sound big \u201cbut when spread globally for what is required to transition, it leaves us where we started: with low-income countries struggling to shoulder the rising costs of a climate crisis they never caused\u201d.\n\nShe added: \u201cAs a wealthy nation, and a huge fossil fuel exporter, the Australian government notably failed to drive bigger ambition. This is about realism. Getting better financial arrangements is key to getting global support for rapid fossil-fuel phase-out globally.\u201d\n\nThe deal does not commit the Australia government to paying a particular amount. It has been sharply criticised for what Climate Action Tracker called \u201cinsufficient\u201d climate finance commitments to date \u2013 A$3bn between 2020 and 2025. It was praised for committing A$50m to a loss and damage fund during the summit.\n\nGreenpeace Australia Pacific\u2019s head of advocacy, Susie Byers, said given that Australia was bidding to host a UN climate summit in 2026 with Pacific countries it had both \u201ca responsibility and a strong interest in stepping up\u201d. That meant the government presenting a climate plan early next year that would play the country\u2019s part in aiming to limit global heating, she said.\n\n\u201cAustralia must also honour the spirit of [last year\u2019s] commitment to transition away from fossil fuels and replace its exports of coal and gas with renewable energy,\u201d she said.\n\nRichie Merzian, the chief executive of the Clean Energy Investor Group and a former climate diplomat, said a more ambitious finance deal was warranted but the end result was a \u201cpractical outcome\u201d and Bowen deserved credit for his role.\n\n\u201cNow we need to get on with action to build the renewables, implement the transition and turn our complete attention to developing 2035 emission reduction targets due next year,\u201d he said.\n\nThe Australian government had hoped to win the rights to host Cop31 in November 2026 during the Baku summit, but a decision under the UN\u2019s consensus process was deferred after the other contender, Turkey, resisted pressure to step aside.\n\nThe agreement in Baku sets a deadline for the decision of June 2025, when climate diplomats meet in Bonn, Germany, but it could drag on until Cop30 in Brazil next November.\n\nIn a post on Bluesky reflecting on Cop29, Bowen posted a picture of himself talking with the UN secretary-general, Ant\u00f3nio Guterres. He said \u201ctackling climate change is in our national interest and getting climate finance right is vital for our nearest neighbours in the Pacific\u201d.\n\n\u201cThis Cop wasn\u2019t easy, but it was important,\u201d he said. \u201cWe also welcome the very strong ongoing support for Australia to host Cop31.\u201d","issue":"cop29","url":"https:\/\/www.theguardian.com\/australia-news\/2024\/nov\/25\/australia-urged-to-do-more-on-climate-crisis-after-playing-role-in-trillion-dollar-cop29-shortfall","sources":[{"Name":"Erin Ryan","Biography":"Senior international campaigner at Climate Action Network Australia","Information":"Erin Ryan criticized the outcome of Cop29, emphasizing that it favored the interests of high-income countries and the petrostate host, Azerbaijan.

{"title":"COP 29 Recap: From Financial Breakthroughs to Missed Opportunities","author":"Patricia da Matta","content":"The \u2018finance\u2019 COP, held in Baku over the past two weeks, has finally drawn to a close \u2013 albeit 33 hours (or is it decades?) too late. Tasked with addressing one of the most pressing questions for climate action \u2013 how to finance global mitigation and adaptation efforts \u2013 the 29th edition of the UN Climate Change Conference, COP29, concluded with an agreement that marks progress, but which fell short of what many were calling for, leaving us with mixed reactions to the ultimate COP outcome.\n\nZooming into nature-specific outcomes at COP, there is little to report, but this was never billed as a big COP for nature. All eyes are on Brazil in that regard. That\u2019s not to say that the past two weeks were all bad news for nature.\n\n**The new finance deal**\n\nUnder the framework established by the UN in 1992, 23 developed countries and the European Union, historically responsible for the majority of emissions, are obligated to contribute to climate finance. However, agreeing on the amount and establishing a fair framework for payments has proven far more complex. In this context, the COP29 climate summit in Baku marks a significant breakthrough: for the first time in 15 years, the UNFCCC Parties have set a long-term financial target to mobilise $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 across, \u2013 which would include funding from all public and private sources. A target of $300 billion annually has been established to \u201cprime the pump\u201d to support vulnerable nations in building resilience, expanding energy access, and fostering sustainable development \u2013 though no specific mentions of sectorial action can be found in the final text, nor are there any specific references to nature. Developed nations are expected to lead these efforts, with developing countries encouraged to contribute voluntarily.\n\nThe $300 billion target, described as a \u201cfloor, not a ceiling,\u201d serves as a foundation for further financial commitments. The plan aims to redirect global financial systems toward climate action, ensuring investments prioritise the needs of vulnerable nations. Billions in direct financial support are projected to flow to developing countries by 2035, fostering resilience, expanding energy access, and enabling sustainable development. To guide these efforts, the \u201cBaku to Bel\u00e9m Roadmap to 1.3T,\u201d led by the COP Presidencies, will coordinate and drive progress toward this goal.\n\nDespite the progress, the agreement comes with significant compromises. Crucially, the funds will be mobilized from a mix of public and private sources rather than guaranteed grants. Delegates from the poorest nations criticized wealthier countries for their slow and insufficient response, with some labelling the deal as \u201ctoo little, too late.\u201d\n\n**Global UN Carbon Markets \u2013 A Decade in the Making**\n\nAnother major breakthrough at  COP29 was the finalization of rules for global carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. After nearly a decade of negotiations, countries agreed on two mechanisms:\n\n- **Article 6.2:** Regulates bilateral carbon trading between countries.\n- **Article 6.4:** Establishes a global crediting mechanism for emissions reductions.\n\nThese markets could unlock significant funding for climate action while enabling countries to meet their emissions targets more efficiently, and so this has rightly been described by many as a major milestone. \n\nAlthough the work is far from over. For Article 6.4, there is still critical attention required to the standards to ensure they don\u2019t sideline natural climate solutions and Indigenous Peoples, including very impractical language around removals. For Article 6.2, it was agreed that the UN will not oversee the quality of environmental outcomes, nor will errors or inconsistencies receive any sort of penalty. While the agreement includes provisions for transparency to help ensure environmental integrity, there is still a risk that low-integrity deals can be struck, so civil society and media scrutiny will be more important than ever.\n\n**The G20**\n\nAcross the globe, leaders from the 20 largest economies of the world issued a Leaders Declaration reaffirming the goals of the Paris Agreement, reiterating the outcome of the Global Stocktake in Dubai, referencing the G20\u2019s Principles for the Bioeconomy and support for the Tropical Forest Forever Facility. Data launched by Nature4Climate reveals that G20 countries could reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 3370 million tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent per year (MtCO2e) \u2013 comparable to India\u2019s total emissions in 2023 \u2013 by prioritising nature in their climate strategy plans.\n\n**National Contributions to the Rescue?**\n\nHowever, current pledges still chart a path toward 2.7\u00b0C of warming\u2014far beyond the 1.5\u00b0C goal outlined in the Paris Agreement. Nature-based solutions (NbS), which can provide a third of cost-effective mitigation, remain underutilized. Forests dominate existing NbS plans (92%), while ecosystems like mangroves (46%), wetlands (45%), and peatlands (just 4%) are largely overlooked.\n\nTo guide countries in developing comprehensive and investable NDCs, Nature4Climate launched a detailed framework during COP29. Expanding the scope of NbS in NDCs will be critical to closing the ambition gap.\n\n**Speaking of nature\u2026**\n\nNot even crickets made it into the negotiation rooms \u2013 or so it seemed. Nature is a critical, yet vastly underfunded, climate solution. At the finance COP though, nature was sadly overlooked. During the tense NCQG talks, more than 100 organizations urged Parties to include ambitious commitments to finance nature within the new climate goal text. However, in the final stages, all mentions of ecosystems, nature and biodiversity were removed.\n\nThe omission underscores a glaring $700 billion annual funding gap for nature finance. Scaling up investments in nature-based solutions, such as restoring degraded forests or protecting wetlands, could generate up to 20 million jobs by 2030 while safeguarding the natural systems that underpin economies. Yet only 33% of nature-related policies published since the Paris Agreement have allocated budgets.\n\nTo meet climate goals, financial flows to NbS must almost triple by 2030. COP30 offers a chance to correct this oversight, but action must start now.\n\n**Political momentum for forests**\n\nForests, however, did have a minute or so under the spotlight. The Forest and Climate Leaders\u2019 Partnership (FCLP) highlighted progress on six country packages and reported that, over the first three years of the Global Forest Finance Pledge, the 11 participating governments and the European Union have collectively contributed USD 10 billion towards the USD 12 billion initially committed for forest conservation and restoration activities. Meanwhile, US President Joe Biden took his first trip to the Amazon to launch the new Brazil Restoration and Bioeconomy Finance Coalition (BRB Finance Coalition) to accelerate the conservation and restoration of Brazil\u2019s forests, with a targeted, aggregate investment of at least $10 billion by 2030 among all coalition members.\n\nThough these indeed pose positive signs, the crucial ecosystem was notably absent from the decision texts.\n\n**The Road to Bel\u00e9m**\n\nAs 2024 is confirmed to be the hottest year on record, the urgency for transformative action has never been greater. COP29 made progress but left critical issues unresolved. The failure to agree on outcomes from last year\u2019s global stocktake, including a timeline for phasing out fossil fuels, has left the COP30 Presidency with (what feels like) too many checkboxes to tick off.\n\nAs COP29 concludes, Alice de Moraes Amorim Vogas, Head of COP30 Brazil, shares an inspiring vision for COP30 in Bel\u00e9m. Brazil aims to consolidate its leadership in the global climate agenda, showcasing its commitment to transitioning to a low-carbon, inclusive future.\n\nBrazil\u2019s President Lula has called for a \u201cfair, fast, and funded\u201d transition to sustainable energy systems and forest protection.\n\nOne good thing to look forward to (aside from the food) is the promise of the largest Indigenous delegation ever seen, as announced by Minister Sonia Guajajara.\n\n\u201cThe Paris Agreement process is still alive, albeit barely. Hopefully, the ambition evident in fresh NDCs from Brazil and others, coupled with President Lula\u2019s recent G20 Summit comments, will inject fresh vigor into UN climate talks at COP30 \u2013 but the international community would be wise to expect more bumps on the road between Baku and Bel\u00e9m.\u201d\n\n- Clare Shakya, The Nature Conservancy","issue":"cop29","url":"https:\/\/nature4climate.org\/cop-29-recap\/","sources":[{"Name":"United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC) Parties","Biography":"International body associated with the United Nations that facilitates global climate agreements and summits, including the annual Conference of the Parties (COP) meetings.","Information":"The UNFCCC Parties, during the 29th edition of the UN Climate Change Conference (COP29) in Baku, brokered a significant finance agreement aiming to mobilize $1.3 trillion annually by 2035 from both public and private sources to support climate action.

{"title":"2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference","author":"Wikipedia contributors","content":"The 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference or Conference of the Parties of the UNFCCC, more commonly known as COP29, was the 29th United Nations Climate Change conference. Held in Baku, Azerbaijan, from 11 to 22 November 2024.[1] Mukhtar Babayev presided, while Samir Nuriyev headed the Organising Committee.[2][3]\n\nThe conference concluded with an agreement on plans for finance to mitigate the effects of climate change and help developing nations transition to more sustainable energy sources.[4] Rules and a UN registry were agreed to facilitate and record international trading of carbon credits.[5]\n\nThe choice of Azerbaijan as the location for the conference was controversial because it is a major oil and gas producer and authoritarian state with extensive corruption,[6][7][8] with several \"official partners\" of COP29 being businesses directly owned by President of Azerbaijan Ilham Aliyev, or tied to the Aliyev family's businesses.[6][7]\n\n**Critique of choice of location**\n\nCop29 in Azerbaijan\n\nIn December 2023, Azerbaijan was announced as the host of the conference. Held on a rotating schedule, the annual COP summit was set to be hosted by an Eastern European nation. However, Reuters reported that, during the previous COP28 meeting in Dubai, Eastern European countries had agreed to back Azerbaijan's bid for the 2024 edition.[12]\n\nCritics argued that hosting COP29 in Azerbaijan was inappropriate due to the country's poor human rights record and an alleged ethnic cleansing against the Armenian population in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.[13][14] They also highlighted that Azerbaijan was a major fossil fuel producer, with an authoritarian government extensively linked to corruption,[6][15] and saw the choice to assign hosting rights for the COP29 to the country as a way to greenwash its reputation.[16][17]\n\nAdditionally, concerns were raised about the government's repression of journalists and environmental activists before the conference, indicating a suppression of free speech and civil society.[18][19][20] Michael Rubin, senior fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, wrote that COP29 risked legitimizing Azerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev's authoritarian government, comparing the occurrence to the political exploitation of the 1936 Summer Olympics by Adolf Hitler's regime.[21] Reporters and anti-corruption non-profits also criticized extensive corruption occurring in the country, with \"official partners\" of COP29 being businesses that were either owned directly by or tied to the Aliyev family.[6][22]\n\nAmnesty International said the Host Country Agreement (HCA) between Azerbaijan and the UNFCCC should include arrangements that guaranteed that \"all human rights [were] protected and respected\", and must be made public immediately, citing Azerbaijan's human rights violations. The rights group drew a comparison with the situation during COP28, which had been hosted by the United Arab Emirates, stating that it had made multiple efforts to obtain the HCA signed in August 2023. Amnesty received a copy of COP28's HCA in June 2024, and revealed that it had \"significant shortcomings and ambiguities\" in rights protections offered to the participants in Dubai.[23]\n\nOn 11 November 2024, climate activist Greta Thunberg attended a rally in Tbilisi, the capital of Georgia, to protest Azerbaijan's hosting of the COP29. Thunberg and other activists criticized Azerbaijan's repressive government, and use of the summit to \"greenwash\" human rights abuses. She called it \"absurd\" to hold climate talks in an \"authoritarian petrostate\" amid rising emissions and a climate crisis.[24]\n\nAzerbaijani President Ilham Aliyev described the criticism as a \"smear campaign\" and said it \"[could not] derail us from achieving our noble mission to cope with the negative impacts of climate change.\"[8]\n\n**Pre-COP29 negotiations**\n\nAt the Climate Change Conference in Bonn in June 2024, despite positive outcomes on the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) and adaptation indicators for COP29,[25] limited progress was achieved on the effective implementation of Article 6 of the Paris Agreement, with unresolved issues surrounding carbon credit systems and emission avoidance.[26] In the occasion, United Nations Climate Change Executive Secretary, Simon Stiell, stressed the need for further work to address those issues before COP29.[27]\n\nIn July 2024, Azerbaijan announced the institution of the Climate Finance Action Fund (CFAF), a fund that aimed to seek US$1 billion in annual contributions from fossil fuel-producing countries and companies, which would then be re-invested in renewable energy and support of climate projects in developing countries; half of the resources from the CFAF would reportedly be allocated to national plans for the fulfillment of the targets set by the Paris Agreement. 20% of the total revenues would be allocated to a Rapid Response Funding Facility (2R2F) for disaster support.[28][29] \n\nOn 10 and 11 October, Azerbaijan hosted the annual Pre-COP meeting to initiate discussions ahead of COP29. The conference, centered around the motto \"Strengthening Ambitions and Ensuring Action\", opened with COP29 President-designate Mukhtar Babayev, COP28 President Sultan Al Jaber, and UN Deputy Secretary-General Amina J. Mohammed.[30] Guests discussed priorities such as the need for a new climate finance goal to replace the former $100 billion target, the full activation of the Loss and Damage Fund \u2014originally established during the COP27 in Sharm El Sheikh\u2014, and wider support of vulnerable communities. Discussions also included updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) from countries and the finalization of guidelines for carbon markets under Article 6 of the Paris Agreement. Leaders emphasized the need to cap global warming at 1.5\u00b0C, as data from the UN Environment Programme had suggested that existing climate pledges may allow for an overall 2.9\u00b0C increase.[31][32] \n\n**Conference agenda**\n\nCOP29 aimed to implement further measures to limit global warming to 1.5\u00b0C, emphasizing the urgent need for investment in climate action.[38][39] The COP29 Presidency stressed the importance of operationalizing the Loss and Damage Fund to support vulnerable communities, particularly in Small Island Developing States (SIDS) and Least Developed Countries (LDCs), while calling for enhanced Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) in line with 1.5\u00b0C targets and urging the submission of national NDCs by 2025, with a focus on fossil fuel phase-out, increasing renewable energy, and addressing non-carbon-dioxide emissions, such as methane. On adaptation, the Presidency called for all countries to prepare and submit their National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) by 2025 and emphasized the need for scaling up adaptation finance. In addition, COP29 encouraged global financial institutions and the private sector to increase climate finance and foster investment in green innovation. The summit aimed to provide platforms to mobilize business participation and enhance transparency in investment decisions to support climate action.[40] \n\n**Climate finance**\n\nAt COP29, climate finance was considered to be a central topic, focusing on scaling up resources for developing countries to address climate impacts and transition to low-carbon economies. A key agenda item was the negotiation of the New Collective Quantified Goal (NCQG) on climate finance, which would set a new financial target to support developing countries after 2025, building on the previous $100 billion annual commitment.[45][46] Proposed solutions included blended finance, which combined public and private investments to amplify funding for climate initiatives, and debt-for-nature swaps, which would allow countries to re-allocate debt repayments toward environmental and climate projects.[46]\n\nAmong the major developments, multilateral development banks, including the World Bank and European Investment Bank, pledged to increase climate-related lending to $120 billion annually for low- and middle-income countries, while the Asian Development Bank announced $7.2 billion in additional investments and a $3.5 billion adaptation program targeting glacial melting in Central Asia and the Southern Caucasus. Non-profit investor Acumen pledged $300 million for agricultural adaptation in Africa, Asia, and Latin America, while the Climate Investment Funds launched a $75 billion bond issuance program on the London Stock Exchange. The Association of Banks of Azerbaijan also committed nearly $1.2 billion to support the country's low-carbon transition.[47]\n\nAt the conference, world leaders ratified a key framework under Article 6.4 of the Paris Agreement, establishing a UN-backed body to regulate international carbon credit trading. The decision is expected to unlock billions of dollars in climate finance, mainly destined to developing countries.[48]\n\nDelegations also reached an agreement for a deal that would oblige developed nations to make a $300 billion annual climate finance pledge by 2035, in order to help developing countries get access to wider economic resources to tackle emissions and climate disasters. However, poorer nations criticized the amount as insufficient, with many pushing for a minimum $500 billion target. While the deal was seen as a small step, critics, including UN officials, called it a betrayal, especially due to the lack of mandatory contributions for emerging economies like China.[49]\n\nKey points of tension in the negotiations were the donor base, in which developed economies such as the US and the European Union had insisted that more countries with resources like China and the Gulf Cooperation Council countries should have contributed by default, and the share of funding coming from public budgets, where developing countries had insisted on significant increases in public, non-loan grants.[50] The final $300 billion text stated that climate funding will come from both public and private sources, and encouraged voluntary contributions from developing countries, including China and Middle Eastern countries.[51]\n\n**Energy transition**\n\nFollowing COP28 in Dubai, COP29 will focus on advancing the energy transition agenda, with particular emphasis on reducing global reliance on fossil fuels and scaling up renewable energy deployment. Key goals include establishing specific timelines for phasing out coal and developing green hydrogen markets, both of which are critical to achieving the Paris Agreement targets. COP29 will also address energy security concerns, especially for economies heavily dependent on fossil fuels, and will support policies that ensure a just and equitable transition for affected communities.[52]\n\nTo facilitate these shifts, COP29 is expected to promote collaborative frameworks that enable countries to share technology, expertise, and resources. This includes regional integration of renewable energy grids, which can improve energy access while reducing emissions. By advancing these initiatives, COP29 seeks to create sustainable, resilient energy systems that align with long-term climate goals.[46]\n\n**Controversies**\n\nCOP29 Chief Executive, Elnur Soltanov, was secretly recorded discussing potential oil and gas deals during the conference, raising serious concerns about a breach of COP ethics. Critics argued that Soltanov's behavior undermined the conference's goal of transitioning away from fossil fuels, as Soltanov also held a key role in Azerbaijan's energy sector.[53]\n\nEU diplomats criticized Azerbaijan for not putting fossil fuel phase-out on the agenda of the conference, which solely mentioned mitigation.[54] On 31 October 2024, Papua New Guinea's Minister of Foreign Affairs, Justin Tkatchenko, announced that the country would boycott the summit entirely, calling it a \"total waste of time\".[55] \n\nIn October 2024, Human Rights Watch revealed the HCA between the UN and Azerbaijan, which had been signed in August.[56] Although the COP29 HCA was made public prior to the climate conference, unlike COP28, it was described as \"disappointing, but not surprising.\" HRW said the HCA was full of \"significant shortcomings and ambiguities on the protections for participants' rights\". The agreement was released alongside HRW's report exposing the efforts of Azerbaijan's government to \"silence its critics\", where several activists and journalists were arrested on baseless and serious criminal charges.[57][58][59]\n\nOn 14 November 2024, the UN was forced to respond to complaints about the lack of vegan, vegetarian and plant-based food options at the COP29. Reportedly only a single food stall in the event's food court sold vegan options, whereas the majority of food stalls, including a Domino's Pizza, sold meat-based meals. In response to the controversy, vegan campaigners handed out free sandwiches.[60]\n\nOn 15 November 2024, the Kick Big Polluters Out (KBPO) coalition, which included Global Witness, Corporate Accountability, and Corporate Europe Observatory, reported that at least 1,773 fossil fuel lobbyists were granted access to the COP29 climate summit in Baku, surpassing the size of nearly each national delegation, except for Azerbaijan (2,229), Brazil (1,914), and Turkey (1,862). According to the KBPO, the report highlighted the \"disproportionate presence\" of industry representatives in comparison to delegates from the ten most climate-vulnerable nations, which had collectively sent 1,033 participants.[61][62][63]\n\nOn 23 November 2024, The Guardian revealed that a Saudi Arabian delegate had allegedly tried to modify an official negotiating text, a type of document that was usually circulated as non-editable PDF by COP presidencies to all countries simultaneously.[64]\n\nThe campaign website cop29.com was purchased by Global Witness instead of Azerbaijan's COP29 team and became a focal point of controversy. Backed by notable figures such as actor Jude Law and former UN climate chief Mary Robinson, the site advocated for fossil fuel companies to fund climate damages, highlighting their $4 trillion earnings in 2022 compared to the $702 million pledged at the summit. The website was banned at the summit venue, and, according to the Financial Times, Azerbaijan blocked domestic access to the site in what was described as a \"fossil fuel domain name war,\" intensifying debates over the influence of fossil fuel interests in the COP process.[65]\n\nFrank Pallone recounted an alarming encounter during his visit to the UN-led climate conference in Baku. He was confronted by hostile, coordinated questions from local media, which he believed were orchestrated by the Azerbaijani government to intimidate him. He accused the Azerbaijani government of repressing free speech and using the event to deflect criticism of its human rights record. Ed Markey also faced harassment, calling out Azerbaijan for \"greenwashing\" its climate and human rights record. Both lawmakers criticized the country\u2019s treatment of political prisoners and its stance on negotiations with Armenia.[66]","issue":"cop29","url":"https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/2024_United_Nations_Climate_Change_Conference","sources":[{"Name":"Reuters","Biography":"International news organization known for providing global news coverage.","Information":"Reuters reported that during the COP28 meeting in Dubai, Eastern European countries backed Azerbaijan's bid to host COP29 in 2024.

{"title":"What happened at COP29 in week one? A summary for investors","author":"Callum Provan","content":"The Finance and Energy\/Peace, Relief and Recovery Days saw a flurry of activity from investors and other non-state actors in Baku, even as uncertainty remained around the New Collective Quantified Goal on climate finance which must be agreed at COP29.\n\nSome 65,000 attendees welcomed an official day of rest on 17 November after a packed first week. Rumours in Baku Stadium centred on the progress of the COP29 Finance text, which Carbon Brief reported has reduced from 33 to 25 pages. Many brackets, however, signal slow progress in overcoming disagreements and a challenging week ahead for negotiators.\n\nSeveral world leaders did not attend, including US President Biden, French President Macron, and the EU\u2019s Ursula von der Leyen, though other countries did announce new climate plans. The UK, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates shared updated Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) at the conference, setting a standard for other nations to follow.\n\n\u201cThis statement of intent signals UK leadership on climate and offers a valuable opportunity to attract clean energy investments, spur clean growth, and strengthen investor confidence in the country\u2019s climate trajectory.\u201d\n\nThe UK plans to cut 81% of greenhouse gas emissions by 2035, relative to 1990 levels, while Brazil pledged to cut emissions 59-67% by the same year, relative to 2005. The United Arab Emirates, host to last year\u2019s COP28, announced its plan to reduce 47% of its emissions by 2035, relative to a notably higher baseline of 2019.\n\nReacting to the UK announcement, Stephanie Pfeifer, CEO of IIGCC said:\n\n\u201cThis statement of intent signals UK leadership on climate and offers a valuable opportunity to attract clean energy investments, spur clean growth, and strengthen investor confidence in the country\u2019s climate trajectory.\u201d\n\nAn unavoidable investment case\n\nIn the \u2018real economy COP\u2019, our delegation was on the ground to discuss how best to increase investment in emerging markets, the need for more investable NDCs including National Adaptation Plans, and the challenges of decarbonising the built environment.\n\nThis included co-hosting an event with the Atlantic Council, which convened financial institutions and climate finance negotiators in an informal discussion, sharing mutual needs to inform the negotiations. Moderated by Valentina Ramirez, IIGCC Head of Climate Strategy Implementation, investors emphasised the need for industrial policies that incentivise investments in climate solutions, encouraging negotiators to complement their approach to the NCQG to foster stronger engagement with private finance actors.\n\n\"\u201cI can tell you how to talk to the trees, talk to the water. You can connect with Indigenous communities\u2026Businesses have to invest in people.\u201d\n\nOn day two, we co-hosted a panel with the Marrakech Partnership for Global Climate Action to strengthen impactful collaboration between public and private actors to deliver climate finance at scale, particularly in developing countries. The event was convened by the COP29 Presidency with an opening keynote from Nigar Arpadarai, the Azerbaijani Climate Change High-level Champion.\n\nArianna Griffa, IIGCC Senior Policy Manager, moderated a panel with Rowan Douglas, CEO of Climate Risk and Resilience at Howden; Raquel Moses, CEO of the Caribbean Climate Smart Accelerator; and Juan Carlos Jintiach, Executive Secretary of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities.\n\nJuan Carlos, a member of the Shuar Indigenous group in the Amazon Rainforest of Ecuador who was shortlisted for the Nobel Peace Prize, explained to the audience:\n\n\u201cI can tell you how to talk to the trees, talk to the water. You can connect with Indigenous communities\u2026Businesses have to invest in people.\u201d\n\nAttracting investment\n\nOn Friday, we co-hosted an official side event as a founding partner of the Investor Agenda, featuring discussions with IIGCC members, other international investors and government officials. The event began with a reminder that 650 investors, representing more than USD33 trillion in assets under management, signed their support for the 2024 Global Investor Statement on the Climate Crisis.\n\nMatias Cardomingo, General Coordinator for Social and Environmental Impact Analysis for the Ministry of Finance in Brazil, delivered the opening remarks. He outlined the country\u2019s new climate and ecological transformation investment platform, named BIP, which, alongside a suite of supportive green policies, can help to attract investments for the transition.\n\nThis was followed by a panel discussion on policy action to unlock investments for a net zero and resilient economy, moderated by Arianna Griffa.\n\nThe panel featured insights from Erich Cripton, Director of Business Relations at the Caisse de D\u00e9p\u00f4t et Placement du Qu\u00e9bec (CDPQ); Natalie Sinha, Head of Sustainability, Infrastructure Investing at UBS; and Hidehiko Sogano, Director and Managing Executive Officer at Dai-ichi Life Holdings in Japan. Discussions reiterated the need for clear sectoral pathways to support hard-to-abate sectors, underscored by an appetite from private finance to do more.\n\nWe shared new climate solutions guidance for renewable energy infrastructure, which aims to support the COP28 target of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\nA second panel explored how investor action is accelerating the transition to the net zero economy. It was moderated by Nicolette Bartlett, Chief Impact Officer at CDP with panellists Jan K\u00e6raa Rasmussen, Head of ESG and Sustainability at PensionDanmark; Peter van der Werf, Head of Active Ownership and Executive Director at Robeco; and Nana Li, Head of Sustainability and Stewardship, Asia Pacific at Impax Investment Management.\n\nPeter shared Robeco\u2019s \u201ctraffic light system\u201d to assess company and country sustainability maturity and referenced our paper, making NDCs investable, while Nana Li shared new research from Impax IM which supports investment in developing markets.\n\nTaking action\n\nElsewhere, Valentina spoke on a panel focused on de-risking private climate finance, hosted by the Danish Industry, and a panel on the increasing role of pull finance to de-risk investments in emerging markets, hosted by KPMG in the Canada Pavilion.\n\nValentina also moderated a panel on driving innovative approaches to incentivise climate resilience investment, before joining a panel to discuss real economy standards to deliver an equitable net zero future, outlining lessons from the Net Zero Investment Framework.\n\nHugh Garnett, Senior Programme Manager, Real Assets, spoke in an official UNFCCC implementation lab focused on how best to enhance ambition for energy policy. He shared our new climate solutions guidance for renewable energy infrastructure, which aims to support the COP28 target of tripling renewable energy capacity by 2030.\n\nThis came alongside a panel where Hugh discussed investing in innovative solutions to decarbonise the built environment, highlighting the challenge of measuring energy efficiency.\n\nOverall, despite the uncertainty around headline negotiations across finance, mitigation and adaptation, one thing is clear: investors made their voices heard and are taking action. Now, all eyes are on the final week of negotiations.","issue":"cop29","url":"https:\/\/www.iigcc.org\/insights\/what-happened-cop29-in-week-one-summary-investors","sources":[{"Name":"Carbon Brief","Biography":"Carbon Brief is a UK-based website covering the latest developments in climate science, climate policy, and energy policy.","Information":"Carbon Brief reported that the COP29 Finance text had reduced from 33 to 25 pages, indicating some progress.

{"title":"COP29 Ends with Compromise on Climate Financing","author":"Not Specified","content":"The UN climate change conference ended on 24 November with a pledge from developed nations to mobilize at least $300 billion annually to support mitigation and adaptation.\n\nAfter two weeks of intense negotiations, delegates at COP29, formally the 29th Conference of Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change (UNFCCC), agreed to provide this funding annually, with an overall climate financing target to reach \u201cat least $1.3 trillion by 2035\u201d.\n\nThis summit had been dubbed the \u2018climate finance COP\u2019, and representatives from all countries were seeking to establish a new, higher climate finance goal.\n\nThe target, or new collective quantified goal (NCQG), will replace the existing $100 billion goal that is due to expire in 2025.\n\nReacting to the outcome, UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres said that while an agreement at COP29 was absolutely essential to keep the 1.5-degree limit alive, \u201cI had hoped for a more ambitious outcome \u2013 on both finance and mitigation \u2013 to meet the great challenge we face.\u201d\n\nBut he continued, this agreement provides a base on which to build and added: It must be honoured in full and on time. Commitments must quickly become cash. All countries must come together to ensure the top-end of this new goal is met.\"\n\nDeveloping countries, which had sought over $1 trillion in assistance, said the pledge of financing was too little too late.\n\nThe WMO delegation at COP29, headed by Secretary-General Celeste Saulo, highlighted the urgency of drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 and more financing to build resilience, and in particular to strengthen early warning systems.\n\nAccording to WMO\u2019s State of the Climate Update, the year 2024 is on track to be the hottest on record and temporarily hit 1.5\u00b0C. Greenhouse gas levels are at record observed levels. Sea level rise is accelerating, glacier retreat is unprecedented, and extreme weather events have caused major loss of life and livelihoods around the world.\n\n\u201cThe time for action is now,\u201d said Celeste Saulo. \u201cIf you want a safer planet, it\u2019s our responsibility. It\u2019s a common responsibility, a global responsibility,\u201d she said.\n\nThe COP29 outcome is a gesture of support for the most vulnerable, said Celeste Saulo. But much more needs to be done.\n\nFollowing on from COP29, WMO will prioritize accelerated action to strengthen global climate mitigation and adaptation, and reduce loss and damage. It will continue leveraging its State of the Climate reports to inform climate policy, finance, and action.\n\nKey focus areas include scaling up the Early Warnings for All initiative to ensure comprehensive early warning coverage, and advancing Global Greenhouse Gas Watch to improve monitoring and mitigation.\n\nAnother priority is to close the gaps in Earth observations. These are necessary to inform both mitigation and adaptation, as was noted in the SBSTA Chair summary. WMO will take a similar approach to closing the gaps in Multi-Hazard Early Warning Systems.\n\nAt COP29, additional contributions were announced to the United Nations Systematic Observations Financing Facility (SOFF) that is now capitalized with more than US $100 million to support countries in closing their basic weather and climate data gaps.\n\nA consolidated WMO strategy to support countries in updating Nationally Determined Contributions (NDCs) and National Adaptation Plans (NAPs) to reflect these elements will be developed. A critical element will be positioning National Meteorological and Hydrological Services (NMHSs) as the authoritative voice of hydro-meteorological early warnings and central actors in driving science-based solutions, ensuring their enhanced role in implementing climate policies and strategies worldwide.\n\nYoung people will be a key focus. Consultations with youth organizations on climate action will help guide the development of WMO's Youth Action Plan.\n\nOther steps forward at COP29 included:\n\nCountries agreed on the rules for a UN-backed global carbon market. This market will facilitate the trading of carbon credits, incentivizing countries to reduce emissions and invest in climate-friendly projects.\n\nThey agreed to an extension of a programme centered on gender and climate change; and agreement on support for the least developed countries to carry out national adaptation plans.\n\nUN Climate Change Executive Secretary Simon Stiell described the new finance goal agreed at COP29 as \u201can insurance policy for humanity.\u201d\n\n\u201cThis deal will keep the clean energy boom growing and protect billions of lives. It will help all countries to share in the huge benefits of bold climate action: more jobs, stronger growth, cheaper and cleaner energy for all. But like any insurance policy \u2013 it only works \u2013 if the premiums are paid in full, and on time.\u201d\n\nHe acknowledged that no country got everything they wanted, and that the world leaves Baku with a mountain of work to do. \u201cSo, this is no time for victory laps. We need to set our sights and redouble our efforts on the road to Bel\u00e9m,\u201d in the eastern Amazonian region of Brazil, which is set to host COP30 next year.\n\nCOP 29 saw also the launch of the Baku Dialogue on Water for Climate Action, a platform that promotes collaboration and initiatives that accelerate solutions for the water crisis. WMO is one of the co-founding signatories and exercise its mandate to provide robust and science-based evidence.","issue":"cop29","url":"https:\/\/wmo.int\/media\/news\/cop29-ends-compromise-climate-financing","sources":[{"Name":"UN Secretary-General Ant\u00f3nio Guterres","Biography":"Ant\u00f3nio Guterres is the current Secretary-General of the United Nations, an international organization established to promote international cooperation and maintain international order.","Information":"Ant\u00f3nio Guterres emphasized that the agreement reached at COP29, the 29th Conference of the Parties to the UN Framework Convention on Climate Change, was crucial to maintaining the target of limiting global warming to 1.5\u00b0C.
